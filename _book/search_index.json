to Machine Learning Interviews Book","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book\nYou can read the web-friendly version of the book here. You can find the source code on GitHub.\nAs a candidate, I’ve interviewed at a dozen big companies and startups. I’ve got offers for machine learning roles at companies including Google, NVIDIA, Snap, Netflix, Primer AI, and Snorkel AI. I’ve also been rejected at many other companies.\nAs an interviewer, I’ve been involved in designing and executing the hiring process at NVIDIA and Snorkel AI, having taken steps from cold emailing candidates whose work I love, screening resumes, doing exploratory and technical interviews, debating whether or not to hire a candidate, to trying to convince candidates to choose us over competitive offers.\nAs a friend and teacher, I’ve helped many friends and students prepare for their machine learning interviews at big companies and startups. I give them mock interviews and take notes of the process they went through as well as the questions they were asked.\nI’ve also consulted several startups on their machine learning hiring pipelines. Hiring for machine learning roles turned out to be pretty difficult when you don’t already have a strong in-house machine learning team and process to help you evaluate candidates. As the use of machine learning in the industry is still pretty new, a lot of companies are still making it up as they go along, which doesn’t make it easier for candidates.\nThis book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\nThe book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\nThe second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\nAfter you've finished this book, you might want to checkout the 30 open-ended questions to test your ability to put together what you know to solve practical challenges. These questions test your problem-solving skills as well as the extent of your experiences in implementing and deploying machine learning models. Some companies call them machine learning systems design questions. Almost all companies I’ve talked to ask at least a question of this type in their interview process, and they are the questions that candidates often find to be the hardest.\n“Machine learning systems design” is an intricate topic that merits its own book. To learn more about it, check out my course CS 329S: Machine learning systems design at Stanford.\nThis book is not a replacement to machine learning textbooks nor a shortcut to game the interviews. It’s a tool to consolidate your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning. The questions in this book can also help identify your blind/weak spots. Each topic is accompanied by resources that should help you strengthen your understanding of that topic.\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

Whether you want to become an ML engineer, a platform engineer, a research scientist, or you want to do ML but don’t yet know the differences among those titles, I hope that this book will give you some useful pointers.\nThis book focuses more on roles involving machine learning production than research, not because I believe production is more important. As fewer and fewer companies can afford to pursue pure research whereas more and more companies want to adopt machine learning, there will be, and already are, vastly more roles involving production than research.\nThis book was written with two main groups of candidates in mind:\n\nRecent graduates looking for their first full-time jobs.\nSoftware engineers and data scientists who want to transition into machine learning.\n\nI imagine the majority of readers of this book come from a computer science background. The second part of the book, where the questions are, is fairly technical. However, as machine learning finds its use in more industries -- healthcare, farming, trucking, fashion, you name it --  the field needs more people with diverse interests. If you’re interested in machine learning but hesitant to pursue it because you don’t have an engineering degree, I strongly encourage you to explore it. This book, especially the first part, might address some of your needs. After all, I only took an interest in matrix manipulation after working as a writer for almost a decade.\n"},"contents/0-about-the-questions.html":{"url":"contents/0-about-the-questions.html","title":"About the questions","keywords":"","body":"About the questions\nThe questions in this book were selected out of thousands of questions, most have been asked in actual interviews for machine learning roles. You will find several questions that are technically incorrect or ambiguous. This is on purpose. Sometimes, interviewers ask these questions to see whether candidates will correct them, point out the edge cases, or ask for clarification. For these questions, the accompanying hints should help clarify the ambiguity or technical incorrectness.\nMachine learning is a tool, and to effectively use any tool, we should know how, why, or when to use it on top of knowing what it is. Because the “what” questions can be easily found online, and if something can be easily acquired, it isn’t worth testing for. This book focuses on the “how”, “why”, and “when” questions. For example, instead of asking for the exact algorithm for K-means clustering, the question asks in what scenarios K-means doesn’t work. You don’t need to understand K-means to cite its definition, but you do to know when not to use it.\nStill, this book contains a small number of “what” questions. While they aren’t good interview questions, they are good for interview preparation.\n"},"contents/0-about-the-answers.html":{"url":"contents/0-about-the-answers.html","title":"About the answers","keywords":"","body":"About the answers\nI started the book with the naive optimism that I’d write the answers for every question in this book. It turned out writing detailed answers to 300+ technical questions -- while juggling a full-time job, a teaching gig, a raging pandemic with a couple of family members in the hospital -- is a lot.\nGiven the slow progress I’ve been making, I’ve decided that publishing the draft then continuing writing/crowdsourcing the answers might be more productive. The first draft of the book has the answers for about 10% of all the questions. These existing answers, while I believe to be sufficiently mathematically rigorous, prioritize intuitive explanations over mathematical equations. The answers for the questions will be continually updated. Answer contribution via the book’s GitHub repository is much appreciated.\nHiring is a process, and questions aren’t evaluated in isolation. Your answer to each question is evaluated as part of your performance during the entire process. A candidate who claims to work with computer vision and fails to answer a question about techniques typically used for computer vision tasks is going to be evaluated differently from a candidate who doesn’t work with computer vision at all. Interviewers often care more about your approach than the actual objective correctness of your answers.\n"},"contents/0-gaming-the-interview-process.html":{"url":"contents/0-gaming-the-interview-process.html","title":"Gaming the interview process","keywords":"","body":"Gaming the interview process\nPeople often ask me: “Don’t you worry that candidates will just memorize the answers in this book and game the system?”\nFirst, I don’t encourage interviewers to ask the exact questions in this book, but I hope this book provides a framework for interviewers to distinguish good questions from bad ones.\nSecond, there’s nothing wrong with memorizing something as long as that memorization is useful. The problem begins when memorization is impractical -- candidates memorize something to pass the interviews and never use that knowledge again, or don’t know how to use it in real situations.\nFor this book, I aimed to include only concepts that I and many of my helpful colleagues deemed practical. For every concept, I ask: “Where in the real world is it used?” If I can’t find a good answer after extensive research, the concept is discarded. For example, while I chose to include questions about inner product and outer product, I left out cross product. You can see the list of discarded questions in the list of “Bad questions” on the book's GitHub repository. This is far from a foolproof process. As the field expands, concepts that aren’t applicable now might be all that AI researchers ever talk about in 2030.\nInterviews are stressful, even more so when they are for your dream job. As someone who has been in your shoes, and might again be in your shoes in the future, I just want to tell you that it doesn’t have to be so bad. Each interview is a learning experience.

In fact, ML research nowadays is spearheaded by big corporations. See 1.1.2 Research for more details.\nThe first question you might want to figure out is whether you want to work in research or in production. They have very different job descriptions, requirements, hiring processes, and compensations.\nThe goal of research is to find the answers to fundamental questions and expand the body of theoretical knowledge. A research project usually involves using scientific methods to validate whether a hypothesis or a theory is true, without worrying about the practicality of the results.\nThe goal of production is to create or enhance a product. A product can be a good (e.g. a car), a service (e.g. ride-sharing service), a process (e.g. detecting whether a transaction is fraudulent), or a business insight (e.g. “to maximize profit we should increase our price 10%”).\nA research project doesn’t need users, but a product does. For a product to be useful, it has many more requirements other than just performance, such as inference latency, interpretability (both to users and to developers), fairness (to all subgroups of users), adaptability to changing environment. The majority of a production team’s job might be to ensure these other requirements.\nThe given definitions above are, of course, handwavy at best. What’s research and what’s production in machine learning remain a heated topic of debate as of 20213. One reason for the ambiguity is that novel ideas with obvious usefulness tend to attract more researchers, and solving practical problems often requires coming up with novel ideas.\nFor more differences between machine learning in research and in production, see Stanford’s CS 329S, lecture 1: Understanding machine learning production.\nAs a candidate, if you’re unfamiliar with both and not sure whether you want to find roles in research or in production, the latter might be the smoother path. There are many more roles involving production than roles involving research.\n3:\n     One example is the argument whether GPT-3 is research. Many researchers were upset when Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (OpenAI, 2020) was awarded the best paper at NeurIPS because they didn’t consider it research.\n"},"contents/1.1.2-research.html":{"url":"contents/1.1.2-research.html","title":"1.1.2 Research","keywords":"","body":"1.1.2 Research\nAs the research community takes the “bigger, better” approach, new models often require a massive amount of data and tens of millions of dollars in computing. The estimated market cost to train DeepMind’s AlphaStar and OpenAI’s GPT-3 is in the tens of millions each45.  Most companies and academic institutions can’t afford to pursue pure research.\nOutside academic institutions, there are only a handful of machine learning research labs in the world. Most of these labs are funded by corporations with deep pockets such as Alphabet (Google Brain, DeepMind), Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent6. You can find these labs by browsing the affiliations of published papers at major academic conferences including NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL). In 2019 and 2020, Alphabet accounts for over 10% of all papers at NeurIPS[1, 2].\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nNot all these industry labs publish papers -- companies like Apple and Tesla are notoriously secretive. Even if an industry lab publishes, it might only publish a portion if its research. Before joining an industry lab, you might want to consider its publishing policy.

Applied research involves finding solutions to practical problems, but doesn’t involve  implementing those solutions in actual production environments.\nApplied researchers are researchers. They come up with novel hypotheses and theses as well as validate them. However, since their hypotheses and theses deal with practical problems, they need to understand these problems as well. In industry lingo, they need to have subject matter expertise.\nIn machine learning, an example of a research project would be to develop an unsupervised transfer learning method for computer vision, experiment on a standard academic dataset. An example of an applied research project would be to develop techniques to make that new method work on a real-world problem in a specific industry, e.g. healthcare.

This is a rare role, often seen at major research labs in the industry. Loosely speaking, if the role of a research scientist is to come up with original ideas, the role of a research engineer is to use their engineering skills to set up and run experiments for these ideas. The research scientist role typically requires a Ph.D. and/or first author papers at top-tier conferences. The research engineer role doesn’t, though publishing papers always helps.\nFor some teams, there’s no difference between a research scientist and a research  engineer. Research scientists should, first and foremost, be engineers. Both research scientists and engineers come up with ideas and implement those ideas. A researcher might also act as an advisor guiding research engineers in their own research. It’s not uncommon to see research scientists and research engineers be equal contributors to papers7. The different job titles are mainly a product of bureaucracy -- research scientists are supposed to have bigger academic clout and are often better paid than research engineers.\nStartups, to attract talents, might be more generous with the job titles. A candidate told me he chose a startup over a FAAAM company because the startup gave him the title of a research scientist, while that big company gave him the title of a research engineer.\nAkihiro Matsukawa gave an interesting perspective on the difference between the research scientist and the research engineer with his post: Research Engineering FAQs.\n7:\n     Notable examples include “Attention Is All You Need” from Google and “Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners” from OpenAI.\n"},"contents/1.1.3-production.html":{"url":"contents/1.1.3-production.html","title":"1.1.3 Production","keywords":"","body":"1.1.3 Production\nAs machine learning finds increasing use in virtually every industry, there’s a growing need for people to bring machine learning models into production.

There are six major steps in a production cycle.\n\n⚠ On the main skills listed at each step ⚠\nThe main skills listed at each step below will upset many people, as any attempt to simplify a complex, nuanced topic into a few sentences would. This portion should only be used as a reference to get a sense of the skill sets needed for different ML-related jobs.\n\n\nProject scoping\n A project starts with scoping the project, laying out goals & objectives, constraints, and evaluation criteria. Stakeholders should be identified and involved. Resources should be estimated and allocated.\n Main skills needed: product management, subject matter expertise to understand problems, some ML knowledge to know what ML can and can’t solve.\n\nData management\n Data used and generated by ML systems can be large and diverse, which requires scalable infrastructure to process and access it fast and reliably. Data management covers data sources, data formats, data processing, data control, data storage, etc.\n Main skills needed: databases/query engines to know how to store/retrieve/process data, systems engineering to implement distributed systems to process large amounts of data, minimal ML knowledge to optimize the organization data for ML access patterns would be helpful, but not required.\n\nML model development\n From raw data, you need to create training datasets and possibly label them, then generate features, train models, optimize models, and evaluate them. This is the stage that requires the most ML knowledge and is most often covered in ML courses.\n Main skills needed: This is the part of the process that requires the most amount of ML knowledge, statistics and probability to understand the data and evaluate models. Since feature engineering and model development require writing code, this part needs coding skills, especially in algorithms and data structures.\n\nDeployment\n After a model is developed, it needs to be made accessible to users.\n Main skills needed: Bringing an ML model to users is largely an infrastructure problem: how to set up your infrastructures or help your customers set up their infrastructures to run your ML application. These applications are often data-, memory-, and compute-intensive. It might also require ML to compress ML models and optimize inference latency unless you can push these to the previous step of the process.\n\nMonitoring and maintenance\n Once in production, models need to be monitored for performance decay and maintained/updated to be adaptive to changing environments and changing requirements.\n Main skills needed: Monitoring and maintenance is also an infrastructure problem that requires computer systems knowledge. Monitoring often requires generating and tracking a large amount of system-generated data (e.g. logs), and managing this data requires an understanding of the data pipeline.\n\nBusiness analysis\n Model performance needs to be evaluated against business goals and analyzed to generate business insights. These insights can then be used to eliminate unproductive projects or scope out new projects.\n Main skills needed: This part of the process requires ML knowledge to interpret ML model’s outputs and behavior, in-depth statistics and probability knowledge to extract insights from data, as well as subject matter expertise to map these insights to the practical problems the ML models are supposed to solve.\n\n\n\nSkill annotation\n\n\nSystems: system engineering e.g. to building distributed systems, container deployment.\n\nDatabases: data management, storage, processing, databases, query engines. This is closely related to Systems since you might need to build distributed systems to process large amounts of data.\n\nML: linear algebras, ML algorithms, etc.\n\nAlgo: algorithmic coding\n\nStats: probability, statistics\n\nSME: subjective matter expertise\n\nProd: product management\n\n\n\n\nThe most successful approach to ML production I’ve seen in the industry is iterative and incremental development. It means that you can’t really be done with a step, move to the next, and never come back to it again. There’s a lot of back and forth among various steps.\nHere is one common workflow that you might encounter when building an ML model to predict whether an ad should be shown when users enter a search query8.\n8:\n      Praying and crying not featured but present through the entire process.\n\nChoose a metric to optimize. For example, you might want to optimize for impressions -- the number of times an ad is shown.\nCollect data and obtain labels.\nEngineer features.\nTrain models.\nDuring error analysis, you realize that errors are caused by wrong labels, so you relabel data.\nTrain model again.\nDuring error analysis, you realize that your model always predicts that an ad shouldn’t be shown, and the reason is that 99.99% of the data you have is a no-show (an ad shouldn’t be shown for most queries). So you have to collect more data on ads that should be shown.\nTrain model again.\nThe model performs well on your existing test data, which is by now two months ago. But it performs poorly on the test data from yesterday. Your model has degraded, so you need to collect more recent data.\nTrain model again.\nDeploy model.\nThe model seems to be performing well but then the business people come knocking on your door asking why the revenue is decreasing. It turns out the ads are being shown but few people click on them. So you want to change your model to optimize for clickthrough rate instead.\nStart over.\n\nThere are many people who will work on an ML project in production -- ML engineers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, subject matter experts (SMEs). They might come from very different backgrounds, with very different languages and tools, and they should all be able to work on the system productively. Cross-functional communication and collaboration are crucial.\n\n🌳 Tip🌳\nAs a candidate, understanding this production cycle is important. First, it gives you an idea of what work needs to be done to bring a model to the real world and the possible roles available. Second, it helps you avoid ML projects that are bound to fail when the organizations behind them don’t set them up in a way that allows iterative development and cross-functional communication.\n\n"},"contents/1.1.3.2-machine-learning-engineer-vs.-software-engineer.html":{"url":"contents/1.1.3.2-machine-learning-engineer-vs.-software-engineer.html","title":"1.1.3.2 Machine learning engineer vs. software engineer","keywords":"","body":"1.1.3.2 Machine learning engineer vs. software engineer\nML engineering is considered a subfield of software engineering. In most organizations, the hiring process for MLEs is spun out of their existing SWE hiring process. Some organizations might swap out a few SWE questions for ML-specific questions. Some just add an interview specially focused on ML on top of their existing interview process for ML, making their MLE process a bit longer than their SWE process.\nOverall, MLE candidates are expected to know how to code and be familiar with software engineering tools. Many traditional SWE tools can be used to develop and deploy ML applications.\nIn the early days of ML adoption, when companies had little understanding of what ML production entailed, many used to expect MLE candidates to be both stellar software engineers and stellar ML researchers. However, finding a candidate fitting that profile turned out to be difficult, and many companies had relaxed their ML criteria. In fact, several hiring managers have told me that they’d rather hire people who are great engineers but don’t know much ML because it’s easier for great engineers to pick up ML than for ML experts to pick up good engineering practices.\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nIf you’re a candidate trying to decide between software engineering and ML, choose engineering.\n\n"},"contents/1.1.3.3-machine-learning-engineer-vs.-data-scientist.html":{"url":"contents/1.1.3.3-machine-learning-engineer-vs.-data-scientist.html","title":"1.1.3.3 Machine learning engineer vs. data scientist","keywords":"","body":"1.1.3.3 Machine learning engineer vs. data scientist\nML engineers might spend most of their time wrangling and understanding data. This leads to the question: how is a data scientist different from an ML engineer?\nThere are three reasons for much overlap between the role of a data scientist and the role of an ML engineer.\nFirst, according to Wikipedia, “data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.” Since machine learning models learn from data, machine learning is part of data science.\nSecond, traditionally, companies have data science teams to generate business insights from data. When interests in ML were revived in the early 2010s, companies started looking into using ML. Before making a significant investment in starting full-fledged ML teams, companies might want to start with small ML projects to see if ML can add value. A natural candidate for this exploration is the team that is already working with the data: the data science team.\nThird, many tasks of the data science teams, including demand forecasting, can be done using ML models. This is also how most data scientists transition into ML roles.\nHowever, there are many differences between ML engineering and data science. The goal of data science is to generate business insights, whereas the goal of ML engineering is to turn data into products. This means that data scientists tend to be better statisticians, and ML engineers tend to be better engineers. ML engineers definitely need to know ML algorithms, whereas many data scientists can do their jobs without ever touching ML. \nAs a company’s adoption of ML matures, it might want to have a specialized ML engineering team. However, with an increasing number of prebuilt and pretrained models that can work off-the-shelf, it’s possible that developing ML models will require less ML knowledge, and ML engineering and data science will be even more unified.\n\n    \n"},"contents/1.1.3.4-other-technical-roles-in-ml-production.html":{"url":"contents/1.1.3.4-other-technical-roles-in-ml-production.html","title":"1.1.3.4 Other technical roles in ML production","keywords":"","body":"1.1.3.4 Other technical roles in ML production\nThere are many other technical roles in the ML ecosystem. Many of them don’t require ML knowledge at all, e.g. you can build tools and infrastructures for ML without having to know what a neural network is (though knowing might help with your job). Examples include framework engineers at NVIDIA who work on CUDA optimization, people who work on TensorFlow at Google, or AWS platform engineers at Amazon.\nML infrastructure engineer, ML platform engineer\nBecause ML is resource-intensive, it relies on infrastructures that scale. Companies with mature ML pipelines often have infrastructure teams to help them build out the infrastructure for ML. Valuable skills for ML infrastructure/platform engineers include familiarity with parallelism, distributed computing, and low-level optimization.\nThese skills are hard to learn and take time to master, so companies prefer hiring engineers who are already skillful in this and train them in ML. If you are a rare breed that knows both systems and ML, you’ll be in demand.\nML accelerator/hardware engineer\nHardware is a major bottleneck for ML. Many ML algorithms are constrained by processors not being able to do computation fast enough, not having enough memory to store data/models and load them into memory, not being cheap enough to run experiments at scale, not having enough power to run applications on device.\nThere has been an explosion of companies that focus on building hardware both for training and serving ML models, both for cloud computing and edge computing. These hardware companies need people with ML expertise to guide their processor development process: to decide what ML models to focus on, then implement, optimize, and benchmark these models on their hardware. More and more hardware companies are also looking into using ML algorithms to improve their chip design process1112.\nML solutions architect\nThis role is often seen at companies that provide services and/or products to other companies that use ML. Because each company has its own use cases and unique requirements, this role involves working with existing or potential customers to figure out whether your service and/or product can help with their use case and if yes, how.\nDeveloper advocate, developer programs engineer\nYou might have seen developer relationship (devrel) engineer roles such as developer advocate and developer programs engineer for ML. These roles bridge communication between people who build ML products and developers who use these products. The exact responsibilities vary from company to company, role to role, but you can expect them to be some combination of being the first users of ML products, writing tutorials, giving talks, collecting and addressing feedback from the community. Products like TensorFlow and AWS owe part of their popularity to the tireless work of their excellent devrel engineers.\nPreviously, these roles were only seen at major companies. However, as many machine learning startups now follow the open-core business model -- open-sourcing the core or a feature-limited version of their products while offering commercial versions as proprietary software -- these startups need to build and maintain good relationships with the developer community, devrel roles are crucial to their success. These roles are usually very hard to fill, as it’s rare to find great engineers who also have great communication skills. If you’re an engineer interested in more interaction with the community, you might want to consider this option.\n11:\n     Chip Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning (Google AI blog, 2020)\n12:\n     Accelerating Chip Design with Machine Learning (NVIDIA research blog, 2020)\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

I was considering two AI startups that were similar on the surface. Both had just raised seed rounds. Both had about 10 employees, most of these were engineers, and were ready for hypergrowth.\nStartup A already had three customers, had just hired its first salesperson, and was ready to hire more salespeople to aggressively sell. Startup B had two customers, who they called design partners, and had no plan yet of hiring salespeople. I liked the work at startup B more but thought that startup A had a better sales prospect than startup B, and for early-stage startups, sales are essential for survival.\nWhen I told this dilemma to a friend, who had invested in companies similar to both A and B, he pointed out to me that I forgot to consider the key difference between these two startups: A was an applications company while B was a tooling company.\nApplications companies provide applications to solve a specific business problem such as business analytics or fraud detection. Tooling companies create tools to help companies build their own applications. Examples of tools are TensorFlow, Sparks, Airflow, Kubernetes.\nIn industry lingo, an application is said to target a vertical, whereas a tool targets a horizontal.\n\n    \n\n\nApplications are likely made to be used by subject matter experts who don’t want to be cumbered with engineering aspects (e.g. bankers who want applications for fraud detection or customer representatives who want applications to classify customer tickets). Tools are likely made to be used by developers. Some are explicitly known as devtools.\nIn the beginning, it’s easier to sell an application because it’s easier to see the immediate impact of an application and there’s less overhead for adopting an application. For example, you can tell a company that you can detect fraudulent transactions with 10% higher accuracy and the company can just input their data into your application and get out results whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.\nFor a company to adopt a tool, there’s a lot of engineering overhead. They might have to swap out their existing tool, integrate the new tool with the rest of their infrastructure, retrain their staff or replace their staff. Many companies want to wait until a tool proves its usefulness and stability to a large number of companies first before adopting it.\nHowever, for tooling companies, selling becomes a lot easier later on. Once your tool has reached a critical mass with a sufficient number of engineers who are proficient in it and prefer it, other companies might just become a user without you having to sell it. However, it’s really, really hard to get to that critical mass for new tools, and therefore, in general, tooling companies have higher risks than applications.\nAfter talking to my friend, I realized that it’s normal for a company like A to have more customers than a company like B early on. But it doesn’t mean that A has a better sales prospect. In fact, having two large companies as design partners is a really good sign for A.\nA year later, both companies acquired a similar number of customers and grew to have around 30 employees, but more than half of company A are in sales whereas 80% of company B are in engineering.\nThis new understanding helped me narrow down my choices. Because I preferred building tools for developers and wanted to work for an engineering-first instead of a sales-first organization, the decision became much easier.\n\n⚠ Ambiguity ⚠\nWhether a company is an application company or a tooling company might just be a go-to-market strategy. For example, you have a new tool that can address use cases that companies aren’t aware of yet, and you know it’d be hard to convince companies to make significant changes to their existing infrastructures for uncertain use cases. So you come up with a compelling use case that can’t be done without your tool, build an application around that use case, and sell that application instead. Once customers are aware of the usefulness of your tool, you switch to selling the tool directly.\n\n\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nIf you're unsure whether the role involves working with an application or a tool, here are a few questions you may ask.\n\nWho are the main users of your product?\nWhat are the use cases you're targeting?\nHow many people does your company have? How many are engineers? How many are in sales?\n\n\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends. For feedback, errata, and suggestions, the author can be reached here.

Examples of enterprise products are Customer relationship management (CRM) software, project management tools, database management systems, cloud hosting services, etc.\nB2C companies build products for individuals. Examples of consumer products are social networks, search engines, ride-sharing services, health trackers, etc.\nMany companies do both -- their products can be used by individuals but they also offer plans for enterprise users. For example, Google Drive can be used by anyone but they also have Google Drive for Enterprise.\nEven if a B2C company doesn’t create products for enterprises directly, they might still need to sell to enterprises. For example, Facebook’s main product is used by individuals but they sell ads to enterprises. Some might argue that this makes Facebook users products, as famously quipped: “If you’re not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.14”\nThese two types of companies have different sales strategies and engineering requirements. Consumer products tend to rely on viral marketing (e.g. invite your friends and get your next order for free) to reach a large number of users. Selling enterprise products tends to require selling to each user separately.\nEnterprise companies usually have the role of solutions architect and its variances (solutions engineer, enterprise architect) to work with enterprise customers to figure out how to use the tool for their use cases.\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nSince these two types of companies have different business models, they need to be evaluated differently when you consider joining them.\nFor enterprise products, you might want to ask:\n\nHow many customers do they have? What's the customer growth rate (e.g. do they sign on a customer every month)?\nHow long is their sales cycle (e.g. how long it usually takes them from talking to a potential customer to closing the contract)?\nHow does their pricing structure work?\nHow hard is it to integrate their product with their customers' systems?\n\nFor consumer products, you might want to ask:\n\nHow many active users do they have? What's their user growth rate?\nHow much does it cost to acquire a user? This is extremely important since the cost of user acquisition has been hailed as a startup killer15.\nDo users pay to use the product? If not, how are they going to make money?\nWhat privacy measures do they take when handling users' data? E.g. you don’t want to work for the next Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\n14:\n     You’re Not the Customer; You’re the Product (Quote Investigator).\n15:\n     Startup Killer: the Cost of Customer Acquisition by David Skok.\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

Even though there are more small companies than large corporations, large corporations employ more people. According to StackOver Developer Survey 2019, more than half of the 71K respondents worked for a company of at least 100 employees.\n\nI couldn’t find a survey for ML specific roles, so I asked on Twitter and found similar results. This means that an average MLE mostly likely works for a company of at least 100 employees.\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nA piece of advice I often hear and read in career books is that one should join a big company after graduation. The reasons given are:\n\nBig companies give you brand names you can put on your resume and benefit from for the rest of your life.\nBig companies often have standardized tech stack and good engineering practices.\nMajor tech companies offer good compensation packages. Working for them even briefly will allow you to save money to pursue riskier ventures in the future.\nIt's good to learn how a big company operates since the small company that you later join or start might eventually grow big.\nYou'll know what's like to work for a big company so you'll never again have to wonder.\nMost startups are bad startups. Working at a big company for a while will better equip you with technical skills and experience to differentiate a good startup from a bad one.\nFor immigrants, big companies might be the only option since small companies can't afford to sponsor visas.\n\nIf you want to maximize your future career options, spending a year, or even just an internship, at a big company, is not a bad strategy.\nWhether you choose to join a startup or a big company, I hope that you get a chance to experience both environments and learn the very different sets of skills that they teach. You don't know what you like until you've tried it. You might join a big company and realize you never want to join another big company again, or you might join a startup and realize you can't live without the stability big companies give you. \nAnd if you believe that you're offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, take it, whether it's at a big company or a startup.\n\n\n\n👱 Personal story 👱\nAfter graduation, I joined NVIDIA, not because it was a big company, but because I was excited about the opportunity to be part of a brand new team working on challenging projects.\nLooking back, I realized the brand name of NVIDIA helped my work to be taken seriously. Being an unknown employee at an unknown company would have thrown me even further into obscurity.\nI stayed at NVIDIA for a year and a half then joined a startup. I wanted a fast-moving environment with a steep learning curve, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n🌳 Tip for engineers early in your careers: Know what you're optimizing for 🌳\nWith each career decision, be mindful of what you're optimizing for so that you can get closer to your eventual goal. Some of the goals you can optimize for are:\n\nMoney now: some people need or want immediate money, e.g. to pay off debts or to prepare for an economic downturn that they believe will happen in the near future. They might interview with multiple companies and go for the highest bidder. There's nothing wrong with that.\nMoney in the future: some are more concerned with being able to make a lot of money in the future. They might choose to pursue a Ph.D. that pays next to nothing but will help them get a highly paid job later.\nImpact: some focus on making an impact. You might work for a startup that allows you to make decisions that affect millions of users or work for a non-profit organization that changes people's lives.\nExperience diversity: the most interesting people I've met optimize for new experiences. They choose jobs that allow them to do things that they've never done before.\nBrand name recognition: it's not a bad strategy to choose to work for the most well-known company or person in your field. This brand can open many doors for you down the line.\nPersonal growth: those who optimize for this choose the job that allows them to learn the most, which in turn maximizes their career option. They might choose a job because it offers mentorship or allows them to work on new, challenging tasks.\n\nYou can optimize for different things at different stages in your life, but you can only optimize for one thing at a time. You might optimize for new experiences when you're younger, money and recognition when you start having more responsibilities, then impact when you've had enough money to not have to worry about it.\nIf you don't know what you're optimizing for, optimize for personal growth. Get a skill set that maximizes your options in the future14.\n\n🌊 Resources 🌊\nTwitter thread: Advice for people who want to leave a big company to join a startup by Jensen Harris.\nHow to get rich in tech, guaranteed (Startups and Shit, 2016).\nTwitter thread: Joining a startup is not a get-rich-quick scheme by me (shameless plug)\n\n14:\n     This is a corollary of the principle of maximum entropy: the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy.\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

Not only candidates hate the hiring process. Employers hate it too. It’s expensive for companies, stressful for hiring managers, and boring for interviewers. \nWhile a handful of well-known organizations are swamped with resumes, lesser-known companies struggle to attract talent. I keep hearing from small companies that it’s near impossible to compete with offers made by tech giants. After weeks of pulling out all the stops to court a candidate, the company makes an offer only to find out that FAAAM has outbid them. Companies often contract talent agencies that might charge 20-30% first year’s salary for a hire, which easily translates to $50K for an entry-level engineering hire.\nThe competition for talent is especially brutal in Silicon Valley where the high number of companies per capita makes the odds in candidates’ favor. Recruiters, even those from companies that receive millions of resumes every year like Google17, aggressively court potential candidates even if these candidates aren’t looking. The majority of people who took a new job in 2018 weren’t searching for one18.\nSome candidates express a mild annoyance at recruiters’ unsolicited contact. This attitude is often misguided because recruiters are your biggest ally: they work to get you hired. As a candidate, you want to have enough visibility so that recruiters reach out to you.\nEvery company says that they want to hire the best people. That’s not true. Companies want to hire the best people who can do a reasonable job within time and monetary constraints. If it takes a month and $10K to find candidate A who can do 93% of the job but six months and $50K to find candidate B who can do 96% of the job, most companies will go with candidate A. The best engineers can still be overlooked if they don’t highlight the skills that recruiters value.\nYou’d think that when companies hire, they know exactly what they want their new hires to do. Unless it’s an established team with routine tasks, hiring managers can seldom predict with perfect clarity what tasks need to get done or what skills are needed. Sometimes, companies can’t even be sure that they’ll need that person. Sam Altman,  chairman of the startup accelerator Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI, advises companies that, in the beginning, “you should only hire when you desperately need to.”\nHowever, because hiring is so competitive and time-consuming, companies can’t afford to wait until they’re desperate. A desperate hire is likely to be a bad one. Sarah Catanzaro, a partner focusing on AI at Amplify Partners, advises her portfolio companies to start hiring when they’re 50% sure that they need someone.\nImagine a startup that has just raised several million dollars and decided that they want to turn their logs into useful features. They think ML can help them, but don’t know how it’d be done. When the recruiter asks them for a job description, they whip up a list of generic ML-related skills and experiences they think might be necessary. Requirements such as “5 years of experience” or “degrees in related fields” are arbitrary and might prevent them from hiring the right candidate.\n\n🌳 Tip 🌳\nJob descriptions are for reference. Apply for jobs you like even if you don't have all the skills and experiences in the job descriptions. Chances are you don't need them for those jobs.\n\nEngineers start interviewing candidates after one to six months at a new company. New hires begin by shadowing more senior interviewers for a few interviews before doing it on their own, and that’s often all the training they get. Interviewers might have been in your shoes just months ago, and like you, they don’t know everything. Even after years of conducting interviews, I still worry that I’ll make a fool of myself in front of candidates and give them a bad impression of my company.\nThis lack of training means that even within the same company, interviewers may have different interviewing techniques and different ideas of what a good interview looks like. Rubrics to grade candidates -- if in existence at all --  are qualitative instead of quantitative (e.g. “candidates show good debugging skills'”).\nHiring managers also aggregate feedback from interviewers differently. Some hiring managers rely on the average feedback from all interviewers. Some rely on the best feedback -- they’d prefer a candidate that at least one interviewer is really excited to work with to someone whose general feedback is good but no one is crazy about. Google is an example of a company that values enthusiastic endorsements over uniformly lukewarm reviews.\nSome companies, in their aggressive expansion, might hire anyone as long as there’s no reason not to hire them. Other companies might only hire someone if there’s a great reason to hire them.\nIf you think one interview goes poorly, don’t despair. There are many random variables other than your actual performance that influence the outcome of an interview: the questions asked, other candidates the interviewer has seen before you, after you, the interviewer’s expectation, even the interviewer’s mood. It is, in no way, a reflection of your ability or your self-worth. Companies know that too, and it’s a common practice for companies to invite rejected candidates to interview again after a year or so.\n\n17:\n     Google Automatically Rejects Most Resumes for Common Mistakes You've Probably Made Too (Inc., 2018).\n18:\n     Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong (Peter Cappelli, Harvard Business Review, 2019)\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

As ML models often require extensive engineering to train and deploy, it’s important to have a good understanding of engineering principles. Aspects of computer science that are more relevant to ML include algorithms, data structures, time/space complexity, and scalability. You should be comfortable with the usual suspects: Python, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, NumPy, scikit-learn19, and a deep learning framework. Knowing at least one performance-oriented language such as C++ or Go can come in handy. BestPracticer has an interesting list of engineering skills needed for skills at different levels.\n\n\nData cleaning, analytics, and visualization. Data handling is important yet often overlooked in ML education. It’s a huge bonus when a candidate knows how to collect, explore, clean data as well as knowing how to create training datasets. You should be comfortable with dataframe manipulation (pandas, dask) and data visualization (seaborn, altair, matplotlib, etc.). SQL is popular for relational databases and R for data analysis. Familiarity with distributed toolkits like Spark and Hadoop is also very useful.\nMachine learning knowledge. You should understand ML beyond citing buzzwords. Ideally, you should be able to explain every architectural choice you make. You might not need this understanding if all you do is clone an existing open-source implementation and it runs flawlessly on your data. But models seldom run flawlessly, so you’d need this understanding to evaluate potential solutions and debug your models.\nDomain-specific knowledge. You should have knowledge relevant to the products of the company you’re interviewing for. If it’s in the autonomous vehicle space, you’re probably expected to know computer vision techniques as well as computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and motion analysis. If the company builds speech recognition systems, you should know about mel-filterbank features, CTC loss, and common benchmark datasets for the task of speech recognition.\n\n\n19:\n     As of 2019, scikit-learn is as popular as TensorFlow.\n"},"contents/2.1.1.2-non-technical-skills.html":{"url":"contents/2.1.1.2-non-technical-skills.html","title":"2.1.1.2 Non-technical skills","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.2 Non-technical skills\n\nAnalytical thinking, or the ability to solve problems effectively. This involves a step-by-step approach to break down complex problems into manageable components. You might not immediately know how to solve a problem, especially if it’s something you’ve never encountered before, but you should know how to systematically approach it. When hiring for junior roles, employers might value this skill more than anything else. You can teach someone Python in a few weeks, but it takes years to teach someone how to think.\nCommunication skills. Real-world ML projects involve many different stakeholders from different backgrounds: ML engineers, DevOps engineers, subject matter experts (e.g. doctors, bankers, lawyers), product managers, business leaders. It’s important to communicate technical aspects of your ML models to people who are also involved in the developmental process but don’t necessarily have technical backgrounds.\n It’s hard to work with someone who can’t explain what they are doing. If you have a brilliant idea but nobody understands it, it’s not brilliant. Keep in mind that there’s a huge difference between fundamentally complex ideas and ideas made complicated by the author’s inability to articulate them.\n\nExperience. Whether you have completed similar tasks in the past and whether you can generalize from those experiences to future tasks. The tech industry is notorious for downplaying experience in favor of ready-to-burn-out twentysomethings. However, in ML where improvements are often made from empirical observations, experience makes all the difference between having a model that performs well on a benchmark dataset and making it work in real-time on real-world data. Experience is different from seniority. There are complacent engineers who’ve worked for decades with less experience than an inquisitive college student.\n\nLeadership. In this context, leadership means the ability to take initiative and complete tasks. If you’re assigned a task, will you be able to do it from start to finish without someone holding your hand? You don’t need to know how to do all components on your own, but you should know what help you need and be proactive in seeking it. This quality can be evaluated based on your past projects. In school or in your previous jobs, did you only do what you were told or did you seize opportunities and take initiative?\n\nThe skillset required varies from role to role.

Some even argue that this is a proxy to create an exclusive culture -- managers hire only people who look like them, talk like them, and come from the same background as them.\nSome companies have switched the term “culture fit” for terms like “value alignment”. A fit should be alignment to values, not lifestyle, e.g. whether you value constructive criticism, not whether you go out to drink every Sunday afternoon.\nFor most big companies, because their culture is already established, one new employee is unlikely to change the office dynamic and culture fit boils down to whether you’re someone people would like to work with (e.g. you’re not an asshole, you’re not defensive, you’re a team player). For small organizations, culture fit is more important as companies want people who share their mission, drive, ethics, and work habits.\nValue alignment is also about you evaluating whether this is a company you want to work for. Do you believe in their mission and vision? Are their current employees the type you want to be around? Will the company provide a good environment for you to grow? One candidate told me he turned down an offer after being invited to the company’s push-up competition. He didn’t feel like a culture that places so much importance on testosterone-filled activities would be a good fit for him.\n"},"contents/2.1.1.4-junior-vs-senior-roles.html":{"url":"contents/2.1.1.4-junior-vs-senior-roles.html","title":"2.1.1.4 Junior vs senior roles","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.4 Junior vs senior roles\nCompanies might put junior and senior roles on different hiring processes. Junior candidates, who haven’t proved themselves through previous working experience, might have to go through more screenings. Amazon, for example, only requires coding challenges for junior candidates. Senior candidates, however, might be asked more difficult questions. For example, a few companies have told me that they only give the machine learning systems design questions21 to more senior candidates since they don’t think junior candidates would have the context to do those questions well.\nA hiring manager at NVIDIA told me: “When you hire senior engineers, you hire for skills. When you hire junior engineers, you hire for attitude.” I’ve heard this sentiment echo in multiple places. \nA senior director at a public tech company told me that when he interviews junior candidates, including interns and recent college graduates, he cares more about how they think, how they respond, and how they adapt. A junior candidate with weaker technical skills but is willing to learn might be preferred over another junior candidate with stronger technical skills but a horrible attitude.\n\n21:\n     See examples of machine learning systems design questions in Machine Learning Systems Design (Chip Huyen, 2019).\n"},"contents/2.1.1.5-do-i-need-a-ph.d.-to-work-in-machine-learning.html":{"url":"contents/2.1.1.5-do-i-need-a-ph.d.-to-work-in-machine-learning.html","title":"2.1.1.5 Do I need a Ph.D. to work in machine learning?","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.5 Do I need a Ph.D. to work in machine learning?\nNo, you don’t need a Ph.D. to work in machine learning.\nThose who think that a Ph.D. is needed often cite job posts for research scientists that list “Ph.D.” as a requirement. First, research scientist roles make up a very small portion of the ML ecosystem. No other roles, including the popular ML engineer, require a Ph.D.\nEven for research scientists, there are plenty of false negatives. For example, OpenAI, one of the world’s top AI research labs, lists only two requirements for their research scientist position:\n\ntrack record of coming up with new ideas in machine learning\npast experience in creating high-performance implementations of deep learning algorithms (optional)22.\nThe long list of people who have done amazing work in machine learning but don’t have a Ph.D. includes the current OpenAI CTO, IBM Watson master inventor, PyTorch creator, Keras creator, etc.\n\nCompanies know that you don’t need a Ph.D. to do ML research, but still require a Ph.D. because it’s a signal that you’re serious about research. At many companies, the people who screen your resumes aren’t technical and therefore rely on weak signals like Ph.D. to decide whether to pass your resume to the hiring managers.\nEngineering roles that require PhDs are the exceptions, not the norm. Some candidates complain that they get rejected by big companies because they don't have Ph.D.’s. Unless the rejections explicitly say so, don't confuse correlation with causation. People with PhDs get rejected too.\nIn November 2017, Kaggle surveyed 16,000 of their users and found that 15.6% of those working in data science have a Ph.D., 41.8% have only master’s degrees, and 32% have only bachelor’s. However, among those with the highest income, 37.3% (>$200k/year) and 41.% ($150-200k/year) have a doctoral degree.\n\nIf you’re serious about research, a Ph.D. is encouraged. However, you shouldn’t let not having a Ph.D. stop you from applying for a job. If you're interested in a company, build up your portfolio, and apply.\n\n22:\n     When Google AI opened their office in Tokyo, their requirements for research scientists included a PhD, but the founding research scientist of Google AI Tokyo, David Ha, doesn’t have a PhD.\n"},"contents/2.1.2-how-companies-source-candidates.html":{"url":"contents/2.1.2-how-companies-source-candidates.html","title":"2.1.2 How companies source candidates","keywords":"","body":"2.1.2 How companies source candidates\nTo get hired, it might be helpful to put yourself where employers are looking. Out of all possible channels for sourcing candidates, referrals are, by far, the best channel. Recruiters have, for a long time, unanimously agreed on the effectiveness of referrals. Here are some numbers:\n\n82% of employers rated employee referrals above all other sources for generating the best return on investment.\nReferred candidates are 55% faster to hire compared to candidates sourced through career sites.\nThe retention rate of referred employees is 45% after two years, compared to 20% for those from job boards.\nReferred candidates are 2.6 to 6.6% more likely to accept an offer](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/interview-sources/.\nAcross all jobs, referrals account for 7% of applications but 40% of all hires. If you’re referred, you’re almost 6x more likely to get your dream job.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and the former president of Y Combinator, wrote that: “By at least a 10x margin, the best candidate sources I’ve ever seen are friends and friends of friends.”\nLukas Biewald, founder of two machine learning startups Figure Eight and Weights & Biases, analyzed the performance of 129 hires and concluded that:\n“Referral quality was incredibly important – the eight worst hires that I’ve been involved in were all unknown to me and everyone at the company at the time of hiring … The average hire was a ‘might hire again’ but the average employee or personal referral was a ‘definitely hire again’.”\nAn analysis of 15,897 Glassdoor interview reviews for software engineering related roles at 27 major tech companies showed that: “For junior roles, about 10 - 20% of candidates that get to onsites are referred, with Uber leading the chart with almost 30%. For senior roles, that number is higher. Salesforce, Uber, and Cisco all have approximately 30% of their senior onsite candidates referred.”\nThe State of Data Science & Machine Learning survey in 2017 by Kaggle shows that while most people seeking to enter the field look for jobs through company websites and tech job boards, most people already employed in the field got their jobs through recruiters’ outreach or referrals.\n\nFor junior roles, the biggest source for onsite candidates is campus recruiting. Microsoft and Oracle have more than half of their interviewees recruited through campus events such as career fairs and tech talks. Internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Airbnb rely less on campus recruiting, but it still accounts for between 20 and 30% of their onsites. Big tech companies concentrate their recruiting efforts on a handful of popular engineering schools: Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT, Caltech, CMU, University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo. The students recruited from those schools then refer their classmates. The circle goes on, turning those major tech companies into a Tech Ivy alumni mixer.\n\nFrom the employers’ perspective, targeting their most promising sources can reduce the hiring cost as well as the risk of disastrous hires. It is, therefore, not surprising that the default message to most candidates who submit their resumes through less promising sources like online applications is “Thank you, next.” This process is far from ideal as it creates an exclusive, anti-meritocratic environment. Many qualified people are rejected simply because they don’t go to the right school or don’t have the right network. \nIf you’re one of these statistically unlucky candidates, one thing you can hope for is that you have a set of skills and/or portfolio that attract recruiters. Around 15 to 25% of onsite candidates for junior roles at each company are contacted by recruiters. For senior roles, this number doubles.\nIf all else fails, submit your applications and hope for the best. Companies that are the friendliest to online applicants are Twitter, Amazon, and Airbnb with roughly half of their onsite candidates being online applicants. Companies among the most likely to pass on hopeful online applicants are Facebook, Microsoft, and Oracle.\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

First, you can only evaluate something as well as your evaluators allow. Companies can only evaluate a candidate to the extent of the interviewers’ knowledge. If your interviewer has a shallow understanding of X, they won’t be able to evaluate your in-depth understanding of X. Many companies, including those who claim to be ML companies, don’t already have a strong in-house ML team to act as good evaluators35. Second, even strong in-house teams don’t always mean strong evaluators. Therefore, companies have to rely on signals to help them predict whether a candidate would be a good fit.\nAs you might have already suspected, pedigrees make for strong signals. It’s not a coincidence that companies like to advertise how many ex-Googlers or ex-Facebookers they have on the payroll. If you’ve worked as a full-time ML engineer at Google, you must have passed its ML interviews and learned good engineering practices from Google.\nOn resumes, college names matter but not much. Their importance is inversely proportional to seniority. If someone, with all the privileges of an elite education, still has no interesting past projects to put on their resume, the fancy college name might even hurt.\nHowever, going to a popular engineering school has several benefits. First, given two equally mediocre resumes, one from MIT, the other from a college nobody has ever heard of, the recruiters might be more inclined to give the one from MIT a call. Second, popular engineering colleges give you access to recruiters who hire from campus events. Third, you’ll likely have classmates at big companies who can refer you.\nIf you’re a recent graduate, your college name might matter less than your GPA, which shows your dedication during your studies. Still, your GPA doesn’t matter as much if you have other things to show. I’ve had only one employer asking for my GPA, and it was after I’d got the offer so that they could put it in their database.\nThe strongest signal is past experience, especially experience similar to the job you’re applying for. The experience can be work done at your previous jobs, projects you do independently, or competitions you enter. If you’ve placed highly in Kaggle competitions, made significant contributions to open-source projects, presented papers at top-tier conferences, written in-depth technical blog posts, self-published books, or done any interesting side projects, you should put them online and highlight them in your resume. There are so many things you can do to signal to people that you’re proactive, capable, and willing to work hard.\nWhen I asked on Twitter which signal is most important when screening for ML engineering roles, more than 50% of the 2458 respondents picked GitHub/Kaggle. 22% chose previous employers, 15% picked referrals, and only 10% thought school names were the most important signal. There’s a lot of noise in this survey because it’s possible that people picked the signal they wanted to be important instead of signals that were actually important.\n\n    \n\n\n\n⚠ The free project bias ⚠\nIn 2013, Chris Anderson, the author of The Long Tail, tweeted about the advice he received about hiring software developers: “reject anyone who doesn't have a GitHub profile (the more active the better).”\nEven though GitHub/Kaggle in particular and past projects, in general, seem meritocratic, we have to be mindful of the candidates’ circumstances when looking at them. Not everyone can afford to contribute to open-source projects or enter Kaggle competitions. If we place too much importance on voluntary activities, we accidentally punish candidates from less privileged backgrounds -- those who work long hours, have too many responsibilities at home or face online harassment for who they are.\nOne group that suffers if hiring decisions are made based on open-source contributions is women. According to a 2016 research by the National Center for Women & Information Technology, the percentages of women in various software engineering occupations are 21% (Computer Programmers), 18% (Software Developers), and 34% (Web Developers).36 Yet, according to reports on Toptal37 and Wired38, only 3-5% of open-source contributors are women.\nSome hiring managers are aware of this privilege bias. Jeremy Howard, an ex-president of Kaggle and co-founder of fast.ai, responded to my survey on Twitter that he evaluates candidates’ achievements with respect to their backgrounds: “I look for people that have achieved an unusually high level of capability despite limited opportunities or significant constraints. It's been the best hiring signal over many years and companies for me.39”\n\n\n\n🌳 Tip: Sell yourself. Highlight your qualities 🌳\nThe hiring process of most tech companies, including and especially the biggest ones, is far from perfect. It's riddled with biases and loopholes. Yet, it's still being used because of legacy and bureaucracy. Until a better process comes along, the best that candidates can do is to understand the signals employers look for and maximize our visibility. On average, recruiters spend only 7.4 seconds on a resume. If you're a great ML engineer but can't signal to recruiters that you're amazing in those 7.4 seconds, you're out.\n\n\n35:\n     40% of AI startups in Europe don't really use AI according to “The State of AI: Divergence 2018” report by MMC Ventures.\n36:\n     https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf\n37:\n     https://www.toptal.com/open-source/is-open-source-open-to-women\n38:\n     https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

For hiring managers, it’s crucial to assign each interviewer a set of skills to evaluate, so that different interviewers ask different questions and that collectively, they get a holistic picture of where you’re at with all the skills they care about. One interviewer might ask you about theories, a couple about coding, one about ML systems design. Ideally, the interviewer tells you the skills they want to focus on so that you can tailor your answers to highlight those skills. If they don’t, ask.\nRecruiters are often encouraged to share with candidates the names of their interviewers. If they don’t, ask. You can look up your interviewers beforehand to learn what they do. It’ll give you a sense of not only what you’ll be doing if you join the company, but also your interviewers’ areas of interest.\nYou should also ask about the team you’re being considered for. At most companies, you interview for a specific team. However, if you apply to companies such as Google and Facebook, you’re matched with a team after you’ve passed. This means that it’s possible to pass their interview process without getting an offer if no team takes you, though it’s rare40.\nThe following list of interview components is long and intimidating, but companies usually use only a subset of them. The number of interviews in each component also varies. Companies might skip any step if they’re confident about your ability. Strong candidates might even be invited directly to onsites without all the previous steps. On the flip side, candidates that need to travel for onsites might be vetted more rigorously beforehand.\nThe entire process can be long and tiring, but it’s long and tiring for every candidate. You don’t have to answer all questions flawlessly. You only need to do better than other candidates. No company expects you to know everything. The field is moving so fast it’s unrealistic to expect any candidate to know all the latest papers and techniques.\n\n40:\n     How many people failed at the team matching phase when interviewing with Google?

If you apply by yourself, your resume is likely screened by a recruiter first then passed onto the relevant hiring manager. If you’re referred, it might go to the hiring manager directly. For companies inundated with resumes, passing recruiter screening is very difficult.\nPhone screen. The phone screen serves two purposes:\n\nto gauge your interest and expectations\nsell you on the company. Most companies will try to convince you how great the company is regardless of whether they’ll make an offer.\nDuring the phone screen, if the interviewer is an engineer, they might ask technical non-coding questions too.\nTypically, there’s only one phone screen. However, in some cases, you might have two phone screens, either because the team isn’t convinced by your performance on the first, you’re being considered for another team, or it’s standard for that company to have two phone screens.\n\n\n\nCoding challenge. Coding challenges are often given to new graduates and interns. Some teams have their challenge before their phone screen, but most have it after. “Challenge before screen” means they don’t want to talk to you before they know you can code. A challenge typically consists of 1-3 questions that you have between 30 mins and 3 hours to solve. You can prepare for it by practicing on sites like HackerRank or Leetcode. This step might be skipped for candidates with high-quality code online.\n\nOffsite technical interviews. Done remotely, these interviews might require coding. You should ask recruiters before each interview for its scope. If there’s coding involved, ask what platform will be used so you can familiarize yourself with it beforehand. With the rise of remote work, more and more traditional onsite technical interviews are becoming offsite.\nPresentation. This is often required for research scientist roles to evaluate your insights and for developer advocate roles for your communication skills. For research scientists, you have to present your own work, but for other roles, it may be about any technical topic. Some interviewers like this format as it allows them to not only see candidates in action but also learn something new. Make sure you discuss with your recruiter about acceptable topics so that you don’t violate Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with your current or previous employers.\nOnsite interviews. The last and most intimidating aspect of the hiring process can consist of anywhere between 4 and 8 (yes, 8) technical/whiteboard interviews which might include a lunch interview and/or social hangout with some team members. Your lunch host might or might not submit an evaluation. Traditionally, this is done onsite. However, with the rise of remote work, more and more teams are experimenting with remote onsites via conference calls.\n Before your onsite, companies should send you an interview schedule that looks like this. If they don’t, you can ask to get a sense of what your day will be like, and get the names of your interviewers.\n\n\n\n  \n   \n10.00 - 11.30\n   \n   Joan Rivers\n   \n   Software Engineer\n   \n   Coding question\n   \n  \n  \n   11.30 - 12.15\n   \n   Stephen Chow\n   \n   Research Scientist\n   \n   ML theory\n   \n  \n  \n   12.15 - 13.30\n   \n   Ali Wong\n   \n   Engineering Manager\n   \n   Lunch with the team\n   \n  \n  \n   13.30 - 15.00\n   \n   Kumail Nanjiani\n   \n   Research Engineer\n   \n   ML implementation\n   \n  \n  \n   15.00 - 15.30\n   \n   Dave Chappelle\n   \n   VP of Engineering\n   \n   Behavioral questions\n   \n  \n"},"contents/2.2.2-alternative-interview-formats.html":{"url":"contents/2.2.2-alternative-interview-formats.html","title":"2.2.2 Alternative interview formats","keywords":"","body":"2.2.2 Alternative interview formats\nGiven how expensive, time-consuming, and inaccurate the traditional interview process is, companies are experimenting with new interviewing formats.\n\nMultiple-choice online quiz. In the last few years, there have been several startups providing online multiple-choice quizzes as a service to companies who want to use this format as part of their hiring process. The quizzes are timed so that you won’t have time to google the answers. Some companies are using it as the first screen in replacement of the coding challenge.\nQuiz. One or more interviewers might rapidly throw questions at you to test your knowledge and experiences. DeepMind was the company best known for this. Their quiz lasted two to three hours. At some point, their list of questions was leaked and passed among candidates, which might be why DeepMind abolished this format.\nTake-home assignment. Much of ML is still empirical -- knowing the concepts doesn’t necessarily translate to getting things done -- and companies want to see if you can get things done in your comfortable environment. They might give you a paper to reproduce or a problem related to their products to solve and ask you to present your solution. You can look up the solution online, but be ready to defend every architectural choice you make.\nCode debugging. The hard part of coding isn’t writing code, but building upon other people’s code. In this interview, candidates are asked to fix a buggy program, which might be a buggy ML model. This interview allows companies to evaluate your code comprehension, your reactions to other people’s code, and your ability to debug. Stanford uses code debugging when recruiting section leaders41. OpenAI and Snorkel AI are two companies that also use this format.\nPair programming. This is very similar to the traditional coding interview, except that when you get stuck, the interviewer is willing to write code with you, allowing you to continue to the next part.\nGood cop, bad cop. Most companies have one-on-one interviews, but some companies, including Apple and Element AI42, do two-on-one interviews. Candidates have described this format similar to “good cop, bad cop”, with one interviewer asking difficult questions and another helping you out.\n\n\n41:\n     A role similar to teaching assistants.\n42:\n     Yoshua Bengio’s Montreal-based AI startup that suffered a rather bleak outcome.

One reason is that big companies make a lot of hires, so they need to standardize their process. Small companies refine the process as they go. Another reason is that big companies can afford to occasionally make bad hires, whereas a few bad hires can run a small company into the ground.\nAs a result, processes at smaller companies can adapt to each role and each candidate. Processes at big companies can be rigid and bureaucratic and might involve questions irrelevant to the role or the candidate. The standardization at big companies also means that the process is more hackable -- thorough preparation can substantially increase your odds.\nAnother important difference is that big companies can afford to hire specialists, who are great in only a small area. Startups are unpredictable and ever-changing, so they might care less about what you do best and more about whether you can address their most urgent needs.\n"},"contents/2.2.4-interviews-for-internships-vs.-for-full-time-positions.html":{"url":"contents/2.2.4-interviews-for-internships-vs.-for-full-time-positions.html","title":"2.2.4 Interviews for internships vs. for full-time positions","keywords":"","body":"2.2.4 Interviews for internships vs. for full-time positions\nIt’s typically much easier to interview for an internship and then get a return offer as a full-time employee than to interview for a full-time position directly. The interview process is a proxy to predict how well you will perform on the job. If you’ve already interned with a team, they know your ability and fit, and therefore might prefer you to an unknown candidate.\nAt major tech companies, intern programs exist to provide a steady, reliable source for full-time talent. An average intern at Facebook makes $8,000/month, almost twice as much as an average American full-time worker43, and Facebook isn’t even the highest bidder44. It’s hard to justify this salary unless it can offset the recruiting cost later.\nThe interview process for interns is less complicated because an internship is less of a commitment. If a company doesn’t like an intern, that intern will be gone in three months. But if they don’t like a full-time employee, firing that person is expensive. The number of full-time positions is subjected to a strict headcount, but the number of interns often isn’t. Even when a company freezes the hiring process, such as to cut costs, they might still hire interns.\nIf your internship doesn’t go terribly wrong and the company is hiring, you’ll likely get an intern-to-full-time offer. At NVIDIA, the majority of full-time offers for new graduates go to their interns. Rachelle Gupta, an ex-recruiter for Google and GitHub, wrote in one of her answers on Quora that:\n“Ranges [of the intern conversion rates] are between the high 60’s% and can be as high as the low 90’s% at top tech companies. I am defining conversion to mean ‘eligible to convert to full time employment’ and not just eligible for an internship next year. At Google, when a team gets an internship it comes with a full-time role that the intern can convert to.45”\nIf you’re a student, it’s never too early to start looking for internships. It’s not uncommon to intern as high school students. However, if you’ve already passed that phase, don’t fret.

These questions are to get a sense of who you are and maybe to get you more comfortable. For companies that have a dedicated behavioral round, this part should be short during the technical interviews. The behavioral round may or may not be during lunch, which is usually hosted by the hiring manager or a designated behavioral interviewer.\nBehavioral questions are to assess whether your values align with those of the company and whether the company can provide an environment for you to thrive. They can be grouped into four main topics: your background/resume, your interests, your communication style, and your personality.\n"},"contents/2.3.1.1-background-and-resume.html":{"url":"contents/2.3.1.1-background-and-resume.html","title":"2.3.1.1 Background and resume","keywords":"","body":"2.3.1.1 Background and resume\nOne common question that a lot of interviewers start with is “Tell me about yourself”. You should come up with an under-a-minute answer and practice it beforehand. Your answer should be both personal (you’re you and nobody else) and professional (why you’re a good fit for the role). Your answer might guide the rest of the interview.\nInterviewers might also test your general level of expertise with the question: “What level of involvement have you had with [ML|computer vision|natural language processing|etc.]?” Don’t bluff. If you pretend that you’re more experienced than you actually are, the interviewer will find out.\nCompanies will want to know about your career history. They will probably ask about your educational background, your previous jobs, and your past projects. You should highlight two things. One is the decisions you made at each position that had an impact, both positive and negative. Another is why you decided to leave one company to join the next.\nThe interviewer will try to see if you’ve done what you claim on your resume. If you have, how much ownership you took. It’s pretty easy to spot the talkers from the doers just by asking for details. They might pick up one project from your resume and make you explain every choice you made in it. If you claim to be familiar with TensorFlow, be prepared to talk about eager execution, tf.estimator, and distributed training in TensorFlow.\nEmployers will of course want to know about your current job search: why are you looking and what are you looking for. A question that every company asks is whether you have any impending offer/deadline that they should be aware of. Some candidates feel awkward to admit that they don’t have any offer yet for fear that the company will think less of them. Some resort to lying, telling recruiters that they have impending onsites or offers when they don’t.\nYou might be able to get away with it -- some even argue that since companies regularly take advantage of their users and employees, we have no ethical obligation to be honest with them. However, it’s a slippery slope. I wouldn’t want to be the person who lies to get ahead, but it’s a personal decision each of us has to make for ourselves.\n"},"contents/2.3.1.2-interests.html":{"url":"contents/2.3.1.2-interests.html","title":"2.3.1.2 Interests","keywords":"","body":"2.3.1.2 Interests\nIt’s in companies’ financial interest to have their employees passionate about their jobs. They want to make sure that your interests align. Some example questions are:\n\nWhy are you interested in ML?\nWhat interests you about this position?\nWhat do you hope to learn in your next job?\nIn your current role, for what types of problems are you the go-to person? If I asked others on your team this question, what would they say?\n\nJoshua Levy, a founding engineer at the AI-power SaaS company BloomReach, said his go-to interest question is: “Think of a period when you were thrilled and excited to go to work. What made you excited?” Was it the problem you were trying to solve, the impact you could make, the technologies you had access to, the people you worked with, your learning curve, or something else?\nOne pet question for many interviewers is “explain a paper that you really like.” This answer shows not only the kind of problems you’re interested in, but also how far you’re willing to go to understand a problem, and how well you communicate technical concepts. It doesn’t matter what paper you pick, as long as you understand it enough to talk about it. Before your interviews, choose any paper, read it inside out and implement it yourself to understand all the subtleties.\nMy personal favorite is: “What have you done that you’re most proud of?” The answer to this question doesn’t even have to be technical. I once told an interviewer that I’m most proud of the non-profit organization I started in high-school to encourage young people to explore outside their comfort zone. I got an offer.\nInterviewers want to get a sense of who you are: what motivates you to do your best work, how you handle obstacles.

Teamwork is impossible if team members don’t or can’t communicate with each other. Each company will want to evaluate not only how well you communicate but also whether you can adapt to the communication style of the company. For example, if a company is heavy on daily status updates and you prefer to disappear for days to focus on a project and only emerge when you’re done, it might not be a good fit.\nYour communication style and skills are evaluated through the entire process, from your cover letter, how you respond to their emails, to the way you answer each interview question. Companies might also ask explicit questions about how you communicate. Here are some of the questions to think about:\n\nTell me about a time you had to give constructive criticism.\nTell me about a time you received critical feedback.\nHave you ever disagreed with your manager?

Interviewers, therefore, might frame the questions differently.\nHere are some of the questions an interviewer might ask.\n\nHow would your colleagues describe you?\nIf you were interviewing a potential teammate, what traits would you look for?\nIf you needed a partner to solve a programming problem, how would you describe your ideal partner?\nIf you could go back to five years ago, what skill would you learn?\nTell me about a time when you faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge and how you overcame it.\n\nSenior interviewers tend to have a go-to question that they believe reveals the most about a person. In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel revealed that he asked everyone he interviewed: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” This question is hard to answer as it first requires you to know what most people agree on, be able to think independently and be confident enough to express it.\nBe yourself, but don’t be a jerk.

Sometimes, you can learn more about someone from their questions than their answers.\nThe interview process is a two-way street -- not only a company evaluates whether you’re a fit but you also evaluate whether you want to work for that company. You should use every opportunity you have to ask questions to learn about the company -- their mission, vision, values, competitors, future plans, challenges they’re facing, possible career path, policies that you should know about, internal hierarchy, and existing corporate politics.\nYou should learn about the team you’re interviewing for: team composition and dynamics, team events, managerial style, the kind of people they want to bring onto the team. You should also try to get a sense of the projects you’re expected to work on and how your performance will be evaluated.\nIf you care about the visibility of your work -- which is especially important for those early in their career -- you should ask about the company’s publishing policy: do they publish their papers and open-source their code? If a company doesn’t publish at all, you join and disappear -- the outside world has no idea what you work on.\nRecently, there have been employee walkouts at major tech companies to protest their employers’ involvement with certain branches of the government. If that’s what you care about, you should definitely ask your potential employer for their stand on working with the government.\nYour interviewer’s career perspective is a good indication of what yours will be like if you join the company, so you should try to understand what they do and why/how they do it. Why did they choose this company? How is it compared to their previous employers? What do they find challenging about their job? How much freedom do they have in choosing what to work on?\nIf you need more questions to ask, Julia Evans has a pretty great list.\n\n⚠ Never ask your interviewers about compensation ⚠\nUnless the topic is explicitly brought up by the interviewers.

If they only want you for their urgent needs, they might let you go when they’ve outgrown those needs.\nThe company doesn’t respect your time, e.g. canceling your interviews last minute. Either they aren’t that interested in hiring you46, or they are an organizational mess.\nThe majority of questions are bad. It means the company hasn’t spent a lot of time thinking about their hiring pipeline, which leads to poor hiring decisions, which in turn can ruin the company.\nThe company pressures or threatens you into taking their offers. For example, they give you only a day to consider their offer47. Companies should give you at least a week, and if you need more time to wait for interviewing results at other companies, they usually extend their deadline. Companies should hire only the people who want to join them after having considered all options, otherwise, they might keep wondering and leave at the first chance they get.\nThe company displays a culture incompatible with your values. If you have small children, you might want to avoid companies that expect employees to respond to emails at 8pm.

On the long end of the spectrum, Google and DeepMind processes typically take between six weeks and three months. The long process is partly because of their recurring influx of candidates, and partly because they make hiring decisions at the company-level. Every two weeks, the hiring committee at Google meets to look at all the candidates that have passed the interview process and decide on who to hire. If you’ve made it to the hiring committee, your odds look good.\nOn the short end of the spectrum, we have startups and big companies with flat organizational structures. The entire process at a startup can take days if they really want you. Big companies like NVIDIA and Netflix are fast, as they make hiring decisions at the team-level. A team manager can make hiring decisions on the spot. The whole process for my internship at NVIDIA took less than a week. I talked to my manager about converting to full-time in the afternoon and got my offer the next morning.\nThe rest of the companies fall somewhere in the middle. The timeline depends a great deal on your availability for interviews, companies’ availability for interviewing spots, how much they want you, and how much they need you. You should ask your recruiter about the expected timeframe if they haven’t told you already, and inform them of any time constraints you have.\nIf it’s been at least a week after your interviews and you haven’t heard from your recruiter, it’s okay to send a short and respectful check-in.

If hiring decisions followed a uniformly random distribution, the odds at major tech companies would be abysmal. Each year, Google receives several million resumes and hires several thousand, which makes the odds around 0.2%.\nHowever, the odds are not uniformly distributed for people applying for the same role at the same company. It depends on your profile, whether you’re referred and who referred you, how much the company needs that role, who screens your resume, who they already have in their pipeline, how serious other applicants are.\nCompanies have very different screening philosophies -- some give every not-obviously-disqualified candidate a phone screen whereas some only respond to the top applicants.\nAll of these factors, coupled with the fact that few companies publicize the number of resumes they receive or the number of hires each year, make it impossible to estimate the odds from submitting an application to getting an offer.\nHowever, it’s possible to estimate the onsite-to-offer ratio, the percentage of onsites that lead to offers, using the 15,897 interview reviews for software engineering related roles at 27 major tech companies on Glassdoor as of August 2019. This ratio correlates to the yield rate -- the percentage of candidates who accept their offers at a company. Even though the estimation is for software engineering roles, it serves as an indication for ML roles. There are many biases in this data, but hopefully, a large number of reviews smoothes out some noise49. If all reviews suffer from the same biases, they are still useful for comparison across companies.\nThe data shows that the onsite-to-offer ratio ranges from a low of 15% to a high of 70%, whereas the yield rate goes from 50% to 90%. For example, at Google, 18.83% of onsites lead to offers, and 70% accept their offers.\nDue to the biases of online reviews, the actual numbers should be lower. After talking to recruiters and doing extensive research, I found that the onsite-to-offer ratios here are a few percentage points higher than the actual numbers. For example, this and this claim that the onsite-to-offer ratio for Google is 10-20% and Amazon 20%.\nThe offer yield rate of near 90% is unheard of. Recruiters from companies with high yield rates told me that they aim to get those numbers up to 80%. The two companies leading the chart are NVIDIA, Adobe, SAP, and Salesforce. However, companies like Salesforce encourage candidates who accept their offers to leave reviews on Glassdoor, which inflates their actual yield rates.\n\nThe 5 companies with the lowest onsite-to-offer ratios are all Internet giants -- Yelp, Google, Snap, Airbnb, and Facebook -- who are known to be highly selective. Companies with high onsite-to-offer ratios aren’t necessarily unselective. They might be more selective during the screening process and only interview candidates that they really like. Onsites are costly, so the higher the onsite-to-offer ratio, the more financially sound the process.\nThere’s a strong correlation (0.81) between the onsite-to-offer ratio and the yield rate -- the higher the onsite-to-offer ratio, the higher the yield rate. A candidate that gets an offer from Google is more likely to turn it down than a candidate that gets an offer from a less selective company.\nThere are several reasons. First, if a candidate passes the interviews at selective companies like Google or Facebook, they probably have other attractive offers to choose from. Second, selective companies tend to make competitive offers, which incentivizes candidates to get offers from them to negotiate with companies that they really want to work for. Third, the process at those companies usually takes a long time. By the time a candidate receives the offer, they might have already settled at another company. Last but not least, since candidates at Google and Facebook only get matched with a team after they’ve received their offers, they might reject the offers if they don’t like the team.\n\n49:\n     Some of the biases in this data:\n*   Few people actually leave reviews for anything online\n*   Those who do are likely compelled by either a really good or really bad experience\n*   Those who receive offers are more likely to give reviews than those who don’t\n*   Those who accept offers are likely to give reviews than those who don’t\n*   Junior candidates are more likely to give reviews than senior candidates\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

When that time is up and you receive your equity, that equity is said to have been vested.\nEquity grants are vested on schedule which is the same for everyone in the company. The two most common schedules are:\n\nequally over four years. e.g. if you’re granted 100 shares, 25 shares are vested at the end of each year.\na quarter of your equity grants is vested after the first year and the rest is vested equally at the end of each month for the next 3 years.\n\nThe more you stay at a company, the more equity you’ll get. Your new equity grants will also follow a vesting schedule. For example, you’re granted 100 shares when you join. After the first year, you have access to 25 shares. Because you’re performing well, you’re also awarded 80 extra shares over the next 4 years. So, at the end of your second year, you have: 25 old shares + 20 new shares = 45 shares. The longer you stay at a company, the more grants you have left to vest.

Sign-on bonuses for junior roles can go anywhere from $0 to over $100K. For more senior roles, they can be unbounded. I’ve seen sign-on bonuses in the neighborhood of half a million.\nAnnual bonuses are often between 10% and 20% of your base salary. However, companies like Netflix don’t believe in bonuses, but prefer to include bonuses to the base salary because they believe that “$200K base salary with 15% performance bonus” is less attractive to candidates than “$230K base salary.”\n"},"contents/3.1.4-compensation-packages-at-different-levels.html":{"url":"contents/3.1.4-compensation-packages-at-different-levels.html","title":"3.1.4 Compensation packages at different levels","keywords":"","body":"3.4 Compensation packages at different levels\nAs level increases, base salary and bonus increase slowly, but equity increases the most. For junior levels, base salary makes up the largest chunk of your direct compensations. As you level up, the proportion of equity goes up -- higher equity reflects more responsibilities you have towards the company’s success.\n\n    \n"},"contents/3.2-negotiation.html":{"url":"contents/3.2-negotiation.html","title":"3.2 Negotiation","keywords":"","body":"3.2 Negotiation\nCompanies expect you to negotiate. The initial offers are designed to make room for that. They offer the smallest amount you’d accept, not what is fair. I’ve seen candidates who had their offers doubled through negotiation. I’ve also seen people getting paid $100K/year less than their peers because they didn’t.\nNegotiation is stressful. “How much should I ask for?” “Am I being lowballed?” “What if they rescind the offer because they think I’m being greedy?” In case you’re worried about the last question, relax. If you’re respectful during your negotiation, companies won’t rescind their offers. If they do, it’s not a company you want to work for.\nWhen negotiating, it’s important to know how much other people are getting paid and how much you should get paid. The employer has this information since they’ve negotiated with many candidates before, but most of us only negotiate with a handful of employers during our entire life. This imbalance of information gives employers more leverage. It especially hurts candidates of underrepresented groups who don’t have access to people who can guide them through the process.\nThere are several ways you can gather more information:\n\nAsk your peers, especially those who have worked/received offers for similar positions at similar companies. In many societies, there’s a stigma against discussing money. If you ask your friends, don’t ask to satisfy your curiosity. Explain how their answers can help you make important decisions. You can also ask for their opinions without asking them how much they make. For example: ask them for level X at company Y, what’s the range of compensation you should expect, or tell them your offer and ask them if they think it’s fair.\nCheck what other people are getting paid online. There have been several efforts to democratize the compensation information, most notable is levels.fyi where people can share their compensation details anonymously and you can see the range of compensation for certain levels at certain companies. There are also apps like Blind that allow you to anonymously share and get feedback on your offers.\nSee how much other companies offer you. One reason to start your job search early is that you’ll have more time to shop for offers. If you can get one offer, you can get another offer. After three offers, you should have a rough idea. Having competing offers helps a lot with negotiation. Companies always match offers, even if they say they don’t.\n\nWhen negotiating with big companies, it’s easier to negotiate equity grants and bonuses than base salary, since base salary.\nLook beyond direct compensations. You can negotiate for more paid days off, more flexibility at work, a better title, more conferences they’ll sponsor you to attend.\n"},"contents/3.2.1-compensation-expectations.html":{"url":"contents/3.2.1-compensation-expectations.html","title":"3.2.1 Compensation expectations","keywords":"","body":"3.2.1 Compensation expectations\nCandidates dread the question: “What are your compensation expectations?” One way to answer is to get the recruiter to give you a number first. Here’s an example of how you can answer that question.\n“I’m excited about this opportunity and I believe that if it’s a good match, we’ll work out an agreement on compensation details. I’d like to learn more about what this position entails first to have a realistic expectation. It’d also be helpful to me to know the range of compensation one can expect at this position if you can share it with me.”\nThis answer works because it shows that you’re ready to negotiate but you also want to make it work.\nOne problem with asking the recruiter to give a number is that the negotiation will anchor around it. If they give you a number that’s too low, you might feel awkward raising it significantly.\nAnother way to answer is to give them a range without committing to it. Come up with a number you want, add ~20% to it, and give it as the lower range. For example, if you’re aiming for $200k/year, you can say something like this.\n“My range is flexible. However, I’d like to be compensated fairly for my experience, my unique set of skills, and what the job entails. My understanding is that for this position in this area, you can expect between $220k and $240k annually.”\nOnce you’ve given a number, it can only go down, not up, so make sure to give a number you won’t regret later.\nFor more negotiation tips, check out 15 Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer (Harvard Business Review, 2014) and Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer (Haseeb Qureshi, 2016).\n"},"contents/3.3-career-progression.html":{"url":"contents/3.3-career-progression.html","title":"3.3 Career progression","keywords":"","body":"3.3 Career progression\n\n⚠ This section only applies to big companies. At startups, hierarchies are flat and levels are not well-defined. ⚠\n\nFor each offer, you should also look at the level. Most companies have well-defined levels for their software engineering roles that encompass ML roles. Higher levels suggest higher compensations, more decision-making power, and more responsibilities.\n\n    \n\n\n\nMajor tech companies follow very different ladders. For example, engineering roles at Google have levels from L3 to L10, while Facebook E3 to E9, Microsoft from 59 to 80. These levels also map to a more standardized ladder which includes:\n\nentry level (associate/junior) engineer\nengineer\nsenior engineer\nstaff engineer\nprincipal engineer\ndistinguished engineer\n\nUsually, recent college graduates start at the lowest level, master graduates at the level above, and Ph.D. graduates at the next level. There’s not much variance in the base salary for the same level at the same company, as the base salary is usually capped for each level. But there’s a lot more variance in equity grants which can change significantly through negotiation.\nIt’s not uncommon to see strong candidates being offered levels higher than their peers. Sometimes, a company might up your level to give you a higher base salary to match another offer you might have. However, companies might be reluctant to level up a new hire, as the higher level means higher expectations, which, many argue, can negatively affect their ability to succeed at the company.\nFew companies put levels in their offer letters. If you ask, recruiters should tell you, since you’ll find out if you join anyway. It’s fashionable for people in tech to say things like “titles don’t matter”, but they do. In the absence of a perfect method to evaluate someone’s actual professional ability, society responds well to titles. Having a higher level means not only higher compensation but also more freedom in deciding what to work on and more negotiating power if you want to change jobs.\nIn theory, companies should put a lot of thought into designing their levels, and employees should be able to find out what’s expected at each level and what they can do to go up the ladder. If you don’t know, talk to your manager. You can put it as simple as: “I want to build my career here and take on more responsibilities at the company. What do you need to see from me to consider me for the next level?”\nFor more information on engineering levels, checkout Things to know about engineering levels (Charity Majors, 2020).\n"},"contents/chapter-4.-where-to-start.html":{"url":"contents/chapter-4.-where-to-start.html","title":"Chapter 4.

For students, it may start at the beginning of your last year in school. If you’re required to give notice before leaving -- for example, in Germany, leaving employees must give a three-month notice -- this process should start much earlier.

Try to enter at least a couple of Kaggle competitions.\nThree months before your interviews, you might have time to do two to three courses and read three books. For courses, I’d recommend one hands-on course like fast.ai’s Practical Deep Learning for Coders and one theoretical course like Machine Learning by Coursera. You might also want to check out my course at Stanford: Machine Learning Systems Design since the course covers practical challenges and solutions for ML in production. For books, I’d recommend Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al., Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy. \nA week before your interviews, review the notes of CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, especially the parts about gradient descent, activations, and optimizations as well as rewatch Full Stack Deep Learning lectures, especially the ones on Setting up Machine Learning Projects and Infrastructure and Tooling. You might want to skim the questions in part 2 and part 3 of this book again. You should also review your previous projects in case your interviewers want to know all about them.\nA day before your interviews, make sure that you get enough sleep.

Here’s a useful guide on how to get started with Kaggle competitions by Will Koehrsen (2018).\nAsk questions on StackExchange and StackOverflow. These websites are amazing. You can post the most random questions and some good Samaritan on the Internet will probably spend an evening writing a detailed 3000-word answer to it.\nRead Glassdoor reviews for each company you apply to.\nReview all your previous work, at least what you’ve put on your resume. Interviewers might want to know all the details.\nBefore your interviews, do a few coding exercises to get your brain into the problem-solving mode.\nAsk your recruiter for information on your interviewers so you can look up their areas of interest. Not all companies let you know in advance, but few would refuse if you ask.\nDon’t mention anything you can’t be accountable for. Everything you mention in an interview will be fair-game for the interviewer to ask. For example, if you say that you’ve taken a course that covers LDA, the interviewer might ask you to explain LDA.\nThink out loud. Employers are interested in not only your solutions but also how you approach a problem.\nIf you encounter a term you’re not familiar with during interviews, ask for an example.\nAsk questions. The interview process is a two-way street -- not only a company evaluates whether you’re a fit but you also evaluate whether you want to work for that company. If you don’t ask questions, companies might think you’re not interested.\nListen to the interviewer’s feedback and accept their help. Interviewers want to know how well you work with others (in this case, the interviewer).\nAsk your interviewer what skills they are trying to assess so you can tailor your answers.\nCheck your references55. \nInterview at a lot of companies to get practice before interviewing for your dream job.\nThe best time to interview is when you don’t need a job. Even if you don’t have any immediate plan to leave your current job, it’s useful to schedule interviews with a couple of companies to see what is out there and brush up on your interviewing skills.\nHave competing offers.\nThink of interviews as part of the learning process. A rejection isn’t much different from getting a question wrong. You get it wrong now doesn’t mean you’ll always get it wrong.\nThank the interviewers for their time and solicit feedback.\n\n\n55:\n    A candidate excelled in interviews but got rejected because all his references mentioned that he was a bad team player.\n"},"contents/4.4.2-don’ts.html":{"url":"contents/4.4.2-don’ts.html","title":"4.4.2 Don’ts","keywords":"","body":"4.4.2 Don’ts\n\nDon’t pretend that you know something. Don’t give hand-wavy explanations or dismiss a question as unimportant. If an interviewer asks you a question, it’s important to them.\nDon’t give canned responses. If an interviewer asks why you’re interested in Artificial Intelligence, refrain from saying “AI is the new electricity.” This is your chance for your own journey and personality to shine.\nDon’t aggressively steer the conversation to topics that you know well. It’s okay to do it subtly, but don’t ignore the interviewer’s questions. Don’t change the subject. A good interviewer will eventually guide the interview to areas that you know about.56\nDon’t criticize your previous or current employers. In fact, don’t criticize anyone during your interviews. You can talk about the challenges you face when working with them, but you don’t want to be the person who finds faults in everyone. There’s this saying: if everyone around you seems to be a problem, you’re the problem.\nDon’t be intimidated by your interviewer.\nDon’t be afraid to disagree with your interviewers -- some might say something wrong on purpose to see if you catch it.\nDon’t look down on your interviewer either. It’s not uncommon for the interviewer to be more junior than the candidate. They might not have your credentials or experiences, but they still know things that you don’t.\nDon’t talk about your age, marital status, religion, political affiliation. Interviewers aren’t allowed to ask for this kind of information because it’s irrelevant to the job and has the potential for bias.\nDon’t discuss salary with your interviewers, unless explicitly asked. In most organizations, you don’t negotiate offers with your interviewers but with your recruiter or the company’s operation staff.\nDon’t be happy when you get easy questions. You should be concerned that you get questions below your ability because the company might be pegging you down for a position without many learning opportunities.\nDon’t be upset when you get difficult questions. If it’s difficult for you, it’s difficult for everyone.\nDon’t sweat it. If you flunk an interview, move on. There are plenty of other companies. If that’s your dream company, check in with them a year or so later.\n\n\n56 I’ve had a few candidates do that to me and it’s annoying. For example, I’d try to gauge their knowledge in dropouts for RNNs and they’d say: “Dropouts aren’t a big problem for RNNs, vanishing gradients are” and talk about vanishing gradients instead. \n"},"contents/part-ii.-questions.html":{"url":"contents/part-ii.-questions.html","title":"Part II: Questions","keywords":"","body":"Part II: Questions\nThis part contains over 200 questions that have more or less deterministic answers. This type of question is to test your understanding of machine learning concepts. In an hour-long interview, you can cover 10 - 15 of those questions. I rank the questions by three levels of difficulty:\n\n[E]asy - fundamental, everyone should know.\n[M]edium - people who understand a concept beyond just the definition should know.\n[H]ard - people with experience should know.\n\nSome of the knowledge questions are considered bad interview questions, especially those about definitions that can be easily looked up. For example, asking someone to explain PCA is good for evaluating their memorization of PCA, not their understanding of PCA. However, some bad interview questions can still make good questions when practicing for interviews, so I include some definition questions to remind readers that certain concepts are important. \nTechniques go in and out of fashion, but fundamental challenges stay the same. Instead of asking candidates to write out complex equations for certain techniques, this book focuses on the challenges that gave rise to those techniques in the first place. Most of the questions in this section are about why something matters and how it works.\n\n🌳 Tip: Strategy for definition questions  🌳\nWhen asked to give the definition of or explain a technique, always start with the motivation for that technique. For example, if asked to explain LSTM for recurrent neural networks, you should first bring up the problems that arise in normal RNNs and how LSTMs address those problems.\n\n"},"contents/chapter-5.-math.html":{"url":"contents/chapter-5.-math.html","title":"Chapter 5.

There are many characteristics we can use to describe a bottle of wine including age, price, color, alcoholic content, sweetness, acidity, etc. Many of these characteristics are related and therefore redundant. Is there a way we can choose fewer characteristics to describe our wine and answer questions such as: which two bottles of wine differ the most?\nPCA is a technique to construct new characteristics out of the existing characteristics. For example, a new characteristic might be computed as age - acidity + price or something like that, which we call a linear combination.\nTo differentiate our wines, we'd like to find characteristics that strongly differ across wines. If we find a new characteristic that is the same for most of the wines, then it wouldn't be very useful. PCA looks for characteristics that show as much variation across wines as possible, out of all linear combinations of existing characteristics. These constructed characteristics are principal components of our wines.\nIf you want to see a more detailed, intuitive explanation of PCA with visualization, check out amoeba's answer on StackOverflow.

Computer Science","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6. Computer Science\nFor coding questions, the best way to prepare is to write code every day. Programming mastery requires consistent practice.\nHowever, the type of coding you do every day is different from the type of coding asked during interviews, so it’s a good idea to get some practice. Before your interviews, do a few typical software engineering questions to get yourself into the problem-solving, whiteboard coding mode.\nIf you haven’t seen them in a while, pick up a good book on algorithms and data structures and skim it. We recommend the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich and the classic Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen et al.\nWe also recommend practicing websites such as LeetCode, CodeSignal, and HackerRank. Those sites rank problems by difficulty -- you should try to solve medium and hard problems. Most of them have solutions available in case you want to compare your solutions to more optimal ones1\nThis chapter addresses the three major aspects of computer science that are covered in machine learning interviews: algorithms, complexity and numerical analysis, and data, which includes data structures.\n\n🌳 What programming language to use during interviews 🌳\nIf you're comfortable with only one language, feel no qualms using it during interviews. If you're comfortable with multiple languages, listen to the question first before choosing a language. It shows that you understand that different languages are built for different purposes: a language suitable for one task might not be optimal for another.\nPut all the languages you know on your resume but don't feel the need to show them off during interviewers. Employers would rather hire someone really good at one language -- it means that you can learn to be good at other languages -- than hiring someone mediocre at multiple languages.\nBased on the language you choose, interviewers might infer what you're interested in. For example, a hiring manager told me that if a candidate chooses to implement data structures in Python, he knows that this candidate doesn't focus on performance.\nPython has become the de facto lingua franca of machine learning -- most frameworks have Python APIs and most open-source projects are written in Python. It's a useful language to know and most interviewers probably expect it, but don't feel like you have to use it during interviews. If you're more comfortable with another language, use it. Writing a complex model in another language, say Swift, is a lot more impressive and helps you stand out.\nIt also helps if you know at least one performance-oriented language such as C++ or Go. C++ is more popular with more support, but Go is easier to learn and manage. Since more and more machine learning models are being served as web applications, many startups look for machine learning engineers with front-end skills. Fluency in TypeScript or React is a huge plus.\n\n"},"contents/6.3-data.html":{"url":"contents/6.3-data.html","title":"6.3 Data","keywords":"","body":"6.3 Data\nIn an academic or research setting, you likely only work with clean, readily available datasets and therefore can afford to spend most of your time on modeling. In production, it’s likely that you will spend most of your time on the data pipeline. The ability to manage, process, and monitor data will make you attractive to potential employers.\nIn your interviews, you might be asked questions that evaluate how comfortable you are with working with data. At a high level, you should be familiar with reading, writing, and serializing different types of data. You should have your go-to library for dataframe manipulation: pandas is popular for general data applications, and dask is a good option if you want something GPU-compatible. You should be comfortable with at least a visualization library such as seaborn, matplotlib, Tableau, or ggplot.\nIf you want to work with big data, it doesn’t hurt to familiarize yourself with distributed data management systems such as Spark and Hadoop.\nBeyond Python, SQL is still ubiquitous for all applications that require persistent databases, and while R isn’t the sexiest language, it’s handy for quick data analytics.\n"},"contents/6.3.1-data-structures.html":{"url":"contents/6.3.1-data-structures.html","title":"6.3.1 Data structures","keywords":"","body":"6.3.1 Data structures\nIf our world is run by data, then data structures are what keep us from descending into chaos. From the dawn of the digital age, the best minds of computer science have kept themselves up at night thinking of efficient ways to store and manipulate data. Data structures are even more important in machine learning as the field is fueled by big data.\nWhile there are classical data structures that have stood the test of time, developing new data structures and improving on the existing ones are never-ending battles as new formats are introduced and new data are generated at a scale never seen before. Your familiarity with existing data structures, understanding of how they are implemented, and intuition on what data structures to use and when to use them will be highly valuable.\nSome of the data structures whose runtime complexities you should know and that you should be able to implement in at least one language:\n\nTrees: binary search tree, heap, trie (prefix and suffix tree)\nQueues, stacks, priority queues\nLinked lists\nHashMap and HashTable\n\nWe don’t have questions about those data structures here, but you should try to implement them yourself, either on a coding exercise website or locally, and compare with known implementation.\nYou should be comfortable with manipulating popular data formats such as the ubiquitous CSV format and web- and serialization-friendly JSON format. Both CSV and JSON are examples of the traditional row-based file formats: data is stored and often indexed row-by-row.\nIn recent years, the column-based format has become more and more common, as it allows big data applications to quickly extract one feature from all the data points by calling the column corresponding to that feature. Popular data frameworks for machine learning include pandas and dask are optimized for column-based operations. The two common column-based file formats are Parquet, championed by Apache Hadoop, and ORC, championed by Apache Hive.\nRow-based data formats are more efficient for writing while column-based formats are more efficient for reading. If your data is write-once-read-many, use column-based. If it requires regular rewriting, opt for row-based.\nFor more detail on data engineering for machine learning, check out the lecture note on Data Engineering for the course Machine Learning Systems Design.\n"},"contents/chapter-7.-machine-learning-workflows.html":{"url":"contents/chapter-7.-machine-learning-workflows.html","title":"Chapter 7.

You don't need to open your eyes to know that this animal is a dog. It isn't hard to guess.\nThe second shelter has both dogs and cats. Again your mom covers your eyes and your dad picks out an email. This time, you have to think harder to guess which animal is that. You make a guess that it's a dog, and your dad says no. So you guess it's a cat and you're right. It takes you two guesses to know for sure what animal it is.\nThe next shelter is the biggest one of them all. They have so many different kinds of animals: dogs, cats, hamsters, fish, parrots, cute little pigs, bunnies, ferrets, hedgehogs, chickens, even the exotic bearded dragons! There must be close to a hundred different types of pets. Now it's really hard for you to guess which one your dad brings you. It takes you a dozen guesses to guess the right animal.\nEntropy is a measure of the \"spread out\" in diversity. The more spread out the diversity, the header it is to guess an item correctly.

For interviewers","keywords":"","body":"A. For interviewers\nCandidates are frustrated with the hiring process -- it's beyond their control. But hiring managers also seem frustrated with their own processes because they can’t or don’t know how to change them. Every hiring manager I’ve talked to expressed interest in reading this book to learn from other companies. I don't hope to change a system with one book. I just hope it provides a scaffold on which we can start the conversation and establish good interviewing practices.\nHiring for ML roles is competitive. Strong candidates always have options, but strong candidates in ML have a lot more options. A hiring process with the candidates’ experience in mind will give candidates a better impression of your company, making them more likely to accept your offer. A better process can help you attract more suitable candidates, make better hires, which saves you time down the line. Even if it’s a no-hire, you still want to win their allegiance. You might want to reinterview them in the future, they might recommend you to their network, and they can become advocates for your products.\nML interviews are still a black box. For a field so obsessed with qualitative methodologies, it’s surprising that there has been so little qualitative research done on the hiring process for ML roles. Few companies can state with any certainty the correlation between their interview techniques and the quality of hires. Some of the challenges include:\n\nPeople who interview aren't the same people who evaluate performance on the job.\nNo established metrics for interview outcomes and performance outcomes, or the correlation between them57.\nNo control group. Companies don’t hire people who fail their interviews to compare their job performances to the performances of those who pass.\n\nA low hanging fruit is testing your pipeline on existing people within your organization. See how they like the process and whether their performances on the interviews correlate with their performances on the jobs. Another is actively soliciting feedback from candidates. Instead of sending out survey links that nobody clicks on, after each onsite, have someone not involved in the hiring process spend 15 minutes talking to the candidate. Make sure the candidate knows that their feedback won’t affect the hiring decision in any way.\nIf you don’t have a training program for interviewers already, please set up one. Interviewers are both gatekeepers and faces of your organization. Letting new hires shadow for a few interviews isn’t enough. New hires have no idea what they are doing, and companies have no way of standardizing feedback across teams, interviewers, and candidates.\n"},"contents/the-zen-of-interviews.html":{"url":"contents/the-zen-of-interviews.html","title":"The zen of interviews","keywords":"","body":"The zen of interviews\n\nThe goal of the hiring process is to hire people, not to eliminate them.\nInterview questions should be tailored for each candidate. Companies who ask different candidates for the same role the same questions are process-driven, not people-driven.\nStandardized interview questions lead to standardized answers which, in turn, leads to standardized people.\nIf a piece of knowledge is easy to acquire, it’s not worth testing for.\nAsk questions with multiple hurdles. After giving the candidate a hint, the question becomes slightly easier, but there’s still room for the candidate to show off their skills.\nAsk hard questions. Extraordinary candidates can write up a simple solution within an hour, and there’s no upper bound on how much a candidate can improve the solution. Asking hard questions shows that you think about and work on hard problems, which attracts people who want to solve hard problems.\nA good interview is a question that turns into a conversation.\nFor long-term hires, interviews should focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills instead of techniques. Techniques change over time, but critical thinking and problem-solving skills will always be relevant.\nBoth interviewers’ and candidates’ time should be respected.\nInterviews should be transparent. For each interview, not only the final evaluation but also the log of the questions and answers should be submitted.\n\n"},"contents/b.-building-your-network.html":{"url":"contents/b.-building-your-network.html","title":"B. Building your network","keywords":"","body":"B. Building your network\nIf you didn’t think that having a network mattered much before, I hope that this book has changed your mind. Having the right network can open you up to new opportunities and bring you closer to your dream jobs.\nThe best contacts are people you’ve studied or worked with. The main value of attending a selective school or joining a selective company is for the network. Your friends from MIT or Stanford might eventually join FAAAM, and your friends from FAAAM might eventually start their own companies.\nIf a network isn’t a built-in feature of your education, you’ll have to make an effort. I get it, you hate networking. The reward function for talking to strangers is stochastic. Once in a while, you meet someone you hit it off with. But most of the time, it’s boring. I haven’t been to a networking event since my first year in college. Why spend an evening standing in a corner at a networking event while you can sit on your couch, eating pizza and browsing memes?\nBut networking doesn’t have to be about meeting random strangers and forcing a connection. It can be about finding people who share your interests and learning new things from them. Seek out people who’ve done things that you enjoy, and try to have a constructive discussion about their work.\nWhen I just started out in ML, I tried to reimplement papers. When I came across something I didn’t understand or something I thought could have been done differently, I emailed the authors. Most people are receptive to discussions about their work -- everyone wants their work to be more popular. I got to know a lot of people in the process.\nSometimes, back-and-forth emailing isn’t effective and I ask people to meet for coffee or hop on a call. They sometimes don’t respond or say no. I receive messages like that too. As long as the senders are respectful, their messages make me happy (somebody acknowledges my work!) and I try to make time for them. If I don’t respond or say no, it’s because I’m busy or forgetful.\nPublish your work so that people interested in it can reach out to you. I enjoy doing side projects to satisfy my own curiosity, but they also help put my name out there. I often receive emails along the lines of: “Your analysis of X is really cool. Do you think it’d work on Y?” or “Can I use it in my project Z?” Sometimes, we find ways to work together, and sometimes, they become my friends. I’ve more than once received emails from people I admire but have no courage to reach out to.\nSocial networks help a lot if you’re mindful of how you use them. ML people are surprisingly active on Twitter. I follow people whose opinions I value and contribute to their public conversations when I have things to contribute. I post what I care deeply about so that I attract only people who share my interests. If someone posts something I find helpful or thoughtfully responds to my post, I send them a short message to thank them for their effort.\nTop-tier conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL, SIGGRAPH, are also great for meeting people. Many might disagree with me on this, but I believe that since most top-tier conferences publish their talks and papers online, the main value of going to a conference is to meet other attendees. You should check out the conference schedule and browse the list of accepted papers in advance to see who is going and reach out to those you want to meet. While at the conference, try to talk to as many people as possible about their work (and yours, too).\nYou’ll make a lot more out of a conference if you present your work, either at the main conference or at one of the workshops. There are, of course, exceptions but in general, it’s easier getting a paper accepted to a workshop than to the main conference. Major conferences and workshops often have travel grants for accepted authors who need financial assistance.\nBuilding a network is a lifelong process, not something that you can “hack” over a weekend. Be open to meeting new people, discovering what they know that you don’t. Don’t approach someone because you want to be friends with them -- you can’t force friendships and it’s borderline creepy. Approach someone because there’s something you want to talk with them about. Friendships will naturally occur if there’s mutual interest.\nWhen you’re ready to look for opportunities, don’t be afraid of letting relevant people in your network know. Most people are happy to put in referrals for strong candidates. They want to work with smart people and they also get a referral bonus if their candidates are hired.\nYou can reach out to people outside your network for referrals too. I’ve more than once referred candidates who cold-emailed me asking for referrals. Engineers are usually better than recruiters at judging someone’s technical skills. If you lack signals that recruiters look for, you might have better luck impressing other engineers.\nThe best job search strategy is to build an impossible-to-ignore portfolio. Write in-depth technical blog posts or papers, contribute to open-source projects, do hackathons, compete in coding challenges, and most importantly, publish your work so that the world knows what an amazing engineer you are.\n"},"contents/2.3.3-bad-interview-questions.html":{"url":"contents/2.3.3-bad-interview-questions.html","title":"2.3.3 Bad interview questions","keywords":"","body":"2.3.3 Bad interview questions\nMost interviewers you meet will be bad interviewers. Few companies have proper interview training programs. Junior interviewers lack the experience to know what signals to look for and lack the technical depth to evaluate your expertise. Senior interviewers might be set in their way with their list of pet questions and might defend to the death the merit of their techniques even in light of contradicting evidence.\nBad interviewers ask bad questions. Even good interviewers sometimes ask bad questions. Here are some examples of bad interview questions.\n\nQuestions that ask for the retention of knowledge that can be easily looked up\n Example: “Write down the equation for Adam optimizer.”\n These questions reward those who happen to review this piece of knowledge before the interview or those who prioritize rote learning. Good candidates might be able to work out an equation eventually, but it’s probably not the best use of interview time. The knowledge that can be easily acquired isn’t worth testing for.\n\nQuestions that evaluate irrelevant skills\n Example: “Write a linked list.”\n Interviewers who ask these questions defend their decision by saying that it’s important for ML engineers to have good coding skills. This is based on the assumption that the ability to write linked lists signals coding ability, but it often only signals that a candidate has practiced for a standard software engineering interview. A better approach is to ask candidates to write solutions for practical tasks such as remove duplicated samples in a dataset that doesn’t fit in memory.\n\nQuestions whose solutions rely on one single insight\n Example: “Take derivative of  x^x .\"\n Solving these questions relies on having seen them before or one moment of brilliant insight. It says nothing about one’s ability.\n\nQuestions that try to evaluate multiple skills at once\n Example: “Explain PCA to your grandma.”\n If a candidate does poorly, you have no idea if it’s because they don’t understand PCA or because they don’t know how to talk to grandmas. A good interviewer would isolate the skills they want to evaluate. For example, interviewers can first give candidates a problem that can be solved with PCA (e.g. a dataset has a lot more features than samples). If candidates bring up PCA, interviewers ask them to explain PCA intuitively.\n\nQuestions that use specific hard-to-remember names.\n Example: questions about “Moore–Penrose inverse” or “Frobenius norm.”\n Candidates might know pseudoinverse or matrix norm without knowing that they are called Moore–Penrose and Frobenius. This can be especially hard for non-native English speakers who study in another language. If you encounter a term you’re not familiar with during interviews, ask for an example.\n\nOpen-ended questions with one expected answer\n Some interviewers ask open-ended questions that have multiple possible answers. However, because they know only one answer, they expect candidates to come up with that exact solution. This can be frustrating for candidates.\n\nEasy questions during later interview rounds\n Example: “Find the longest common subsequence.”\n Once these questions are solved, there isn’t much room for improvement. Answering them poorly means that a candidate is unqualified, but answering them well doesn’t mean that a candidate is good. These questions are okay during screening to make sure that a candidate can pass a bar, but bad for later interview rounds when you want to know how high a candidate can jump.\n\n\nWhen asked a question that you think is bad, should you tell your interviewer that it’s bad? There’s a non-zero chance that your interviewer might appreciate your candid feedback, but statistically speaking, they might get offended and write you off as someone they wouldn’t want to work with.\nInstead, you should ask for clarification. If stuck, explain why you’re stuck and what information you’d need to overcome it. If unsure about the interviewer’s intention, ask. “To better answer your question, is it to evaluate my understanding of X?” should be sufficient.\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

Some might argue that since many of the common objective functions in deep learning aren't convex, we don't need to know about convex optimization. However, even when the functions aren't convex, analyzing them as if they were convex often gives us meaningful bounds. If an algorithm doesn't work assuming that a loss function is convex, it definitely doesn't work when the loss function is non-convex.\nConvexity is the exception, not the rule. If you're asked whether a function is convex and it isn't already in the list of commonly known convex functions, there's a good chance that it isn't convex. If you want to learn about convex optimization, check out Stephen Boyd's textbook.\n\n\nOn Hessian matrix\n\nThe Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. \nGiven a function f : ℝn → ℝ.

It is also commonly used for expressing image processing operators in image processing and computer vision for tasks such as blob detection and multi-scale signal representation.\n"},"contents/5.2.1.2-questions.html":{"url":"contents/5.2.1.2-questions.html","title":"5.2.1.2 Questions","keywords":"","body":"5.2.1.2 Questions\nIf some characters seem to be missing, it's because MathJax is not loaded correctly.

The probability that X takes on a value in a measurable set S \\subseteq E is written as:\nP(X \\in S) = P({\\omega \\in \\Omega | X(\\omega) \\in S}), where P is the probability measure on (\\Omega, F). \nThe randomness comes from the randomness of the outcomes in \\Omega.\nInformally, a random variable is a variable that probabilistically takes on different values. You can think of a random variable as being like a variable in a programming language. They take on values, have types, and have domains over which they are applicable.\nRandom variable is a general concept. Almost everything in life can be described using a random variable. The time it takes you to commute to work is a normal random variable. The number of people you date before finding your life partner is a geometric random variable.\nProbability distribution\nA probability distribution is a function that describes possible outcomes of a random variable along with its corresponding probabilities.\nNormal random variable\nAlso known as the Gaussian random variable, this is the single most important random variable. It's parameterized by a random variable, parametrized by a mean \\mu and variance \\sigma^2.\n\n    X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n    f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})\n\nThe term we want to go over in this function is -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}. Intuitively, it punishes the value far away from the mean, but the punishment is less when the variance is high. The term \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} is normalization so that it integrates to 1.\n\n    E[X] = \\mu \\\\\n    Var(X) = \\sigma^2\n\nHere is the PDF of the normal distribution with different parameters.\n\n    \n\n\nCategorical distribution\nAlso known as the multinoulli distribution, the categorical distribution is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution. It describes the possible results of a random variable that can take on one of k possible categories, with the probability of each category separately specified.\n\n    X \\in \\text{Cat}(\\phi); \\phi = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_k) \\text{ and }\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i = 1\n\nBinomial random variable\nA binomial random variable represents the number of successes in n successive independent trials, each succeeding with probability p and failing with probability 1-p. One example is the number of heads in n coin flips, each with a 0.5 probability of landing head. The binomial distribution is the basis for the binomial test for statistical significance. When there's only 1 trial, it's known as the Bernoulli distribution.\n\n    X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p) \\\\\n    P(X=k) = {n \\choose k} p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \\\\\n    E[X] = np \\\\\n    Var(X) = np(1-p)\n\nBelow is the PMF of the binomial distribution with different parameters.\n\n    \n\n\nMultinomial random variable\nThe multinomial random variable is a generalization of the binomial distribution. Instead of having only two outcomes like with a coin flip, it can have multiple outcomes like with a k-sided die. When the number of trials is 1, it's the categorical distribution.\n\n    X \\sim \\text{Multi}(n, \\pi) \\text{ with } \\pi = (p_1,p_2, ..., p_k ) \\text{ and }\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i = 1 \\\\\n    P(X=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)) = \\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2! ... x_k!} \\prod_{i=1}^kp_i{x_i} \\text{ with } n = \\sum_i^kx_i \\\\\n    E[X_i] = np_i \\\\\n    Var(X_i) = np_i(1-p_i)\n\nPoisson random variable\nThe Poisson distribution is, in my opinion, among the more interesting distributions. It expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval if these events occur with a known constant rate. This rate is denoted as \\lambda. Note that the Poisson distribution is memoryless, which means the probability that an event occurs is independent of the time since the last event.\nOne pretty neat perspective is to see the Poisson distribution as an approximation of the Binomial where n is large, p is small, and \\lambda = np. For example, a Binomial random variable of 10000 trials with the success rate of 0.01 can be seen as a Poisson random variable of events happening every 10000 * 0.01 = 100 trials.\n\n    X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda) \\\\\n    P(X=i) = \\frac{\\lambda^i}{i!}e^{-\\lambda} \\\\\n    E[X] = \\lambda \\\\\n    Var(X) = \\lambda \\\\\n\nBelow is the PMF of the Poisson distribution with different values of \\lambda, made by Skbkekas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nPoisson vs binomial according to Data Science Central:\nIf your question has an average probability of an event happening per unit (i.e. per unit of time, cycle, event) and you want to find the probability of a certain number of events happening in a period of time (or a number of events), then use the Poisson Distribution.\nIf you are given an exact probability and you want to find the probability of the event happening a certain number of times out of x (i.e. 10 times out of 100, or 99 times out of 1000), use the Binomial Distribution formula.\n\nGeometric random variable\nIf each trial has the probability of success of p, then the geometric random variable represents the number of independent trials until the first success. One example is the number of candidates you have to interview until you hire someone.\n\n    X \\sim \\text{Geo}(p) \\\\\n    P(X=n) =(1-p)^{n-1}p \\\\\n    E[X] = \\frac{1}{p} \\\\\n    Var(X) = \\frac{1-p}{p^2} \\\\\n\nBelow is the PMF of the geometric distribution with different values of p, made by Skbkekas.\n\n    \n\n\nBeta random variable\nBeta is my favorite distribution (what do you mean you don't have a favorite distribution?). It's a random variable that estimates another random variable.\nSay, we have a coin with an unknown probability of turning heads. Let p represent this probability. After n + m flips, we get n heads and m tails. We might want to estimate that p = \\frac{n}{n+m}. However, this is unreliable, especially if n+m is small. We'd like to say something like this: p can also be more than, less than, or equal to \\frac{n}{n+m}, the values further away from \\frac{n}{n+m} having a smaller probability. And the higher the value of n+m, the higher the probability of p being \\frac{n}{n+m}. The beta distribution allows you to do that.\nThe beta random variable is represented using two variables: \\alpha to represent the number of successes and \\beta to represent the number of failures. The beta distribution can represent beyond coin flips. In fact, \\alpha and \\beta can rerepsent continuous value (though they can't be non-positive).\n\n    x \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\text{ with } 0 \n\\Gamma is the Gamma function: \\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!. The term \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha + \\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)} is the normalization constant so that the expression integrates to 1.\n\n    E[X] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\\\\n    Var(X) = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2(\\alpha + \\beta + 1)}\n\nWe can also incorporate a priori belief in the beta distribution. For example, if before even flipping the coin, we believe that the coin has a moderate chance of being biased towards heads, we can set the a priori to be \\text{Beta}(4, 2). Then after 10 coin flips of which 7 are heads and 3 are tails, we can update the distribution to be \\text{Beta}(4 + 7, 2 + 3) = \\text{Beta}(11, 5). In fact, in Bayesian inference, the beta distribution is the conjugate prior probability distribution for Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, and geometric distributions.\nBelow is the PDF of the geometric distribution with different parameters.\n\n    \n\n\nThe multivariate generalization of the beta random variable is called Dirichlet.\nExponential family of distributions\nA class of distributions is in the exponential family if it can be written in the form:\n\n    p(x; \\eta) = h(x)\\exp(B(\\eta)T(x) - a(\\eta))\n\nwhere:\n\n\\eta is the parameter of the distribution, e.g. if it's the normal distribution then \\eta = (\\mu, \\sigma).\nT(x) is the sufficient statistic. For most distributions, T(x) = x. For the beta distribution, T(x) = (\\log x, \\log(1-x)).\na(\\eta) is the normalization constant so that the expression integrates to 1.\n\nThe exponential family of distribution is important because it provides a general framework for working with many of the most common distributions, including the Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, normal, and more.\nYou can write the PMF and PDF of those distributions to match the form defined above. For example, given the Poisson random variable \\text{Poi}(\\lambda), with f(x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!}\\exp(-\\lambda), belongs to the exponential family because f(x) can be written in the form h(x)\\exp(B(\\eta)T(x) - a(\\eta)).\n\n    f(x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!}\\exp(-\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{x!}\\exp(\\log(\\lambda)x - \\lambda) \\\\\n    \\eta = \\lambda \\\\\n    h(x) = \\frac{1}{x!} \\\\\n    B(\\eta) = \\log(\\eta) \\\\\n    T(x) = x \\\\\n    a(\\eta) = \\lambda\n\nMore examples that show that other distributions belong to the exponential family can be found here and here.\nMarginal distribution, joint distribution, conditional distribution\nA joint probability distribution gives the probability of two or more events happening at the same time. For example, given two discrete random variables X and Y, the joint probability distribution of X and Y gives the probability of P(X=x, Y=y) for any combination of value x \\in X and value y \\in Y.\nA marginal distribution gives the probabilities of various values of a subset of variables without reference to the values of the other variables. For example, given the joint distribution of X and Y, we want to have a marginal probability distribution of X without reference to Y. \n\n    P(X=x) = \\sum_yP(X=x, Y=y)\n\nA conditional probability distribution gives the probability of a subset of events occurring assuming that other events also occur. One example is P(X|Y).\n\nThis book was created by Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends. For feedback, errata, and suggestions, the author can be reached here.
